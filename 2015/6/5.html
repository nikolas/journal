    I don't have anything to do on E-WORTH for now, so
    I've been fixing more open PMT items for the PMT,
    and setting up behave tests for
    <a href="http://eldex.org/">ELDEx/UELC</a>.

    For our Django CMS hack-a-thon today, I looked at
    <a href="http://www.django-cms.org/en/">django-cms</a>. It was easy
    to integrate into our Django template
    (<a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/ccnmtldjango">ccnmtldjango</a>),
    but the admin interface was awkward and reminded me of Drupal 7. With
    all of its jQuery modals and mouseover events, it's clear that django-cms
    isn't the most forward-thinking CMS library.

    I'm looking forward to helping put together
    <a href="http://welcome.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/">our main CCNMTL site</a>,
    which is currently in WordPress/EdBlogs, in one of the
    alternatives we looked at:
    <a href="http://mezzanine.jupo.org/">Mezzanine</a>.
