    Paul Ford's
    <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/"
       >What is Code?</a> article takes us through the events and
    dramas that unfolded in the last 50 years in technology, in an
    attempt to explain what exactly programmers spend their time
    doing these days. It explains the traditions, lore, and thought
    processes of certain groups of programmers in an entertaining,
    illuminating way. One accurate point the author makes throughout
    the article is that the software world is
    constantly changing in ways that are unique to this industry,
    with specific parts of it changing quicker than others.

    I finished the article feeling empty and less curious about the
    practice of programming. Part of that feeling came from
    realizing, for the millionth time, that there is no "magic"
    going on inside a computer. Paul Ford's article had animated
    diagrams of NAND/XOR/etc. gates to solidify that point. I guess
    I already knew that, but for some reason it always bothers me.
    Another part of it came from Paul Ford making it obvious how
    big companies really do influence the path of technology.
    I find that part of technology a little boring, but also
    disheartening. I continue to wonder where the anti-corporate
    GNU project will go.

    It's typical for someone who programs, or stitches together,
    complicated websites to have a personal website similar to
    this one, which doesn't even use a static site generator.
    Is this a backlash against all the unnecessary
    layers of abstracton in something like
    "a Yeoman generator for modular AngularJS apps with
    Gulp and optional Polymer support"?
    Paul Ford set up the
    <a href="http://tilde.club/">tilde.club</a> project last fall.

  <p>
    A lot of web programming feels like organizing the appropriate
    packages in the right ways. So I agree with one of Paul Ford's
    points, that programmers tend to be angry people, and I wish
    that wasn't true.
