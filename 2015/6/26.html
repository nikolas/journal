    <h1>Optimizing a slow Django view</h1>
    <time datetime="2015-06-26">Friday, June 26</time>

  <p>
    Here I'll outline some attempts to optimize a slow view &ndash;
    the facilitator view &ndash; in
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/uelc">UELC</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To find out where time was being spent, I added <code>print('a')</code>,
    <code>print('b')</code> etc, throughout the <code>get</code> function,
    and loaded the view while watching the logs.
  </p>

  <p>
    After reducing the query count by removing duplicate calls to
    Pagetree's <code>.block()</code>, I noticed that this page loads
    four columns of data, displayed as a column for each "group user"
    in the template. Each iteration of this loop calculating the columns
    takes about half a second. Not really thinking things through, I
    figured why not calculate this concurrently, splitting it up into
    multiple processes, potentially running on different CPUs? After
    reading about python's
    <code>multiprocessing</code> library, I refactored the for loop into
    the function <code>render_user_gates</code>, and came up with this:
  </p>

  <pre>
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)
    args_list = [[u, hierarchy, section, hand, gateblocks]
                  for u in cohort_users]
    user_sections = pool.map(render_user_gates, args_list)
    print('done', len(user_sections))
  </pre>

  <p>
    This doesn't work.. I think that it may have even messed up my database.
    I got a "multiple hierarchies returned" error from pagetree, so I had to
    get a new database. Because my <code>render_user_gates</code> method makes
    database queries, it's not an option to just disconnect from the database
    at the beginning of this function.
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked on #django if anyone's using <code>multiprocessing.pool</code>
    with Django's ORM. Someone named "moldy" said probably not, because it
    was a really strange thing to do. I guess I didn't even think of how
    this would behave, deployed on a server, running through gunicorn or
    something.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moldy mentioned that this could be a use case for
    <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">celery</a>. I know we use
    that on some other projects, like PMT. I'm reading more about
    celery now &ndash; I don't want to put the time in to set
    everything up until I'm sure that it would work, and also I would
    have to be pretty sure that it will actually improve performance
    in this view.
