  <p>
    I'm setting up this blog on cunix, which I might someday
    integrate with this static site generator I'm working on
    very slowly: <a href="https://github.com/nikolas/oblique">oblique</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    This week we had a few
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/worth2"
       >E-WORTH</a> run-throughs, where the project
    manager, designers, and developers all get together and go
    through the entire application to make sure everything makes
    sense. The time we spent doing this felt very productive.
    Because we found so many issues and small changes to make with
    each piece of the application, it was more like a hack-a-thon
    than a runthrough.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of the remaining problems are things that I hope to find
    a way to integrate into
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/django-pagetree">Pagetree</a>:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Display participants' progress as a percentage instead of just
      complete/incomplete.
    </li>
    <li>
      There's a bug when calculating the participant's "Next, new session"
      <small>(PMT #101095)</small>. This bug causes the next, new session be
      higher than expected, because I'm not differentiating between an
      "accessed" session, and a "completed" session.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The second issue here really came about because the WORTH code
    that calculates "current session/module", and participant progress
    is all pretty confusing, and is spread throughout three different
    places: in the <code>Participant</code> model, in the
    <code>BaseUserProfile</code> model, and in <code>utils.py</code>.
    This was all created in a kind of ad-hoc, as-needed basis, with
    vague goals of generalizing this problem and putting it into
    Pagetree.
  </p>

  <p>
    The central method here is
    <code>Participant.highest_module_accessed</code>. First of all,
    I'm
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/29832005/173630"
       >not that confident</a> that this method is always accurate.
    Also, I think it's poorly named, because it doesn't unambiguously
    convey what I'm trying to do here.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, like I mentioned, I think these issues should be addressed in
    Pagetree. After I apply some quick fixes to WORTH, maybe with Susan's
    help, I want to think about some ways to represent these kinds of
    things in the Pagetree API.
