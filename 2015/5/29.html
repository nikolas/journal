    There's a bunch of places in
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/dmt">PMT</a> that a Markdown preview
    of text that's about to be submitted can be helpful. I've been using a
    JavaScript library called
    <a href="https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable">remarkable</a> to
    render the Markdown preview to HTML (see
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/dmt/blob/master/media/js/src/utils/markdown_preview.js"
       >markdown_preview.js</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    PMT's Markdown previewer can occur in many different places on the same
    page, so I'm initializing each one separately. See
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/dmt/blob/master/media/js/src/forms/project_action_item_modals.js"
       >project_action_item_modals.js</a>, and the parts of
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/dmt/blob/master/dmt/templates/main/item_detail.html"
       >item_detail.html</a> that include
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/dmt/blob/master/dmt/templates/main/item_detail_textarea_preview.html"
       >item_detail_textarea_preview.html</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Markdown previewer could still be more self-contained,
    and it's easy to wish the implementation was simpler. In
    <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, you
    could make a Markdown previewer using an
    <a href="http://guides.emberjs.com/v1.11.0/components/">Ember Component</a>.
    If you look through the
    <a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/">Ember Blog</a>, they seem to be
    heading in the direction of using Components more and more, in
    places where you might have found an <code>Ember.View</code> or an
    <code>Ember.Controller</code> in older Ember code.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is a JavaScript
    framework tailored specifically for this kind of UI-centric use case.
    In fact, React's front page shows
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/#markdownExample">an example</a>
    of a Markdown preview component. I haven't made anything in React yet,
    and
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html"
       >JSX</a> still seems strange to me. But because
    manipulating
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>
    elements with JavaScript requires so much meticulous
    attention to various details,
    some kind of virtual "JavaScript-aware" DOM
    is ultimately necessary. At that point, to rely so heavily on rendering
    everything using JavaScript
    in the user's browser, you lose the simplicity of visiting a web
    site, downloading an HTML document, and displaying it.
    There's an answer to that problem as well. You can render the
    page on both the server and client using the same JavaScript code,
    with the concepts behind
    <a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2014/12/22/inside-fastboot-the-road-to-server-side-rendering.html"
       >Ember FastBoot</a> and the
    <a href="http://isomorphic.net/">Isomorphic JavaScript</a> trend.
  </p>

  <p>
    In summary, I'll try to clean up PMT's Markdown previewer into a
    cleaner conceptual model. I also wonder if isomorphic javascript
    is preferable to traditional javascript applications, and if they
    will ever become the norm.
