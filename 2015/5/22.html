  <h1>Friday, May 22</h1>

  <p>
    I was able to remove a bunch of the code that was causing
    problems in <a href="15.html">my last entry</a>. We decided
    to simplify the UI for the participant sign-in form in our
    Worth sprint this week. I wish we decided it sooner &ndash;
    maybe I should've proposed a change in the beginning.
