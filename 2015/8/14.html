    I'm working on some
    <a href="http://ccnmtldjango.readthedocs.org/en/latest/javascript_unit_testing.html"
       >documentation</a> for writing unit tests in JavaScript using our
    typical mix of RequireJS, jQuery, and Backbone. I ran into an annoying
    problem that I hadn't anticipated: loading jQuery via RequireJS in node
    isn't exactly straightforward. When I include jQuery in the list of my
    module's dependencies and run <code>make mocha</code> I get this error:
  </p>

  <pre>
    module "jquery" failed with error:
    TypeError: Cannot call method 'createElement' of undefined
  </pre>

  <p>
    jQuery has been compatible with node.js for a while (see:
    <a href="http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13768"
       >[1]</a>,
    <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2014/01/24/jquery-1-11-and-2-1-released/"
       >[2]</a>), so I assume this has something to do with how I'm loading
    jQuery. It's being loaded with RequireJS instead of node's
    <code>require()</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, this is one of the quirks I should've known I'd run into when I
    decided to test our front-end code in node.js instead of in a web
    browser. However, I may still be able to continue down this track.
    I could figure out why jQuery isn't being loaded here. Maybe it's
    some stupid thing I haven't thought of yet, or maybe it's possible
    to set up the requirejs config in <code>test-runner.js</code> to
    behave correctly when loading jQuery.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I can't figure out how to include jQuery without a browser's DOM,
    I could try setting up a
    <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a> instance in
    the test runner. Really I just don't want to complicate things too
    much since the test runner is working alright now, and I don't want it
    to become fragile or hard to understand.
