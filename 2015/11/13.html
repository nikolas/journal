	        <a href="https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock">uBlock</a> is
            an ad-blocking browser extension that's compatible with Chrome,
            Firefox, and Safari. The uBlock developers organize the entire
            codebase in a single repository and are able to share common,
            browser-independent logic between the three extensions in that
            way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now I'm working on porting
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/mediathread-chrome"
               >mediathread-chrome</a> to Firefox. The single repository
            structure works for uBlock, but I'm going to try sketching
            out the simplest way to do this with a separate repository
            for each platform. My reasoning is that this is the
            structure we already have in place, and I'm also thinking that
            this way simplifies deployment. Each browser has its own
            set of tools for developing extensions, and I'm worried they'd
            get in eachother's way if everything's in one repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            Firefox extensions are tested and packaged with Mozilla's
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm"
               >jpm</a> tool, which is a node.js program influenced by npm.
            It's possible to use node.js modules in Firefox extensions, in fact,
            this is the preferred way of including third-party code since jpm
            was introduced in early 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chrome extensions, on the other hand, have no special
            relationship to node.js. Chrome doesn't provide an extension
            development tool like Mozilla's jpm. Instead, everything
            is handled in the browser. Coming up with a testing scheme
            is left as an exercise for the developer, but debugging
            is much more seamless: Just add a <code>debugger;</code>
            breakpoint in your extension code, and Chrome behaves as
            if it were JavaScript running on the page. We could use
            npm to install third-party packages on a Chrome extension,
            but I'm already using npm for testing purposes on 
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/mediathread-chrome"
               >mediathread-chrome</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/github-linker/core">github-linker-core</a>
            is an example of an npm module that's compatible with Chrome
            extensions, by using <a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a> as
            part of the build process. So that's one way to approach the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another solution would be to use
            <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> as the package
            manager, instead of npm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or we could archive our "core" library manually and distribute
            the tarball, unpacking it when necessary like we do with
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/mediathread/blob/master/bootstrap.py#L61"
               >Mediathread's bookmarklet</a>. An even simpler way
            would be to copy over common code to update it, making
            sure to keep it separate from the browser-specific code.
            This is the approach I'm going to take for now, since it's
            the simplest and requires the least amount of configuration.
