  <p>
    We use Mediathread's
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/mediathread-chrome">Chrome extension</a>
    to get images, videos, and sounds from the web into Mediathread,
    preserving metadata and source info for those assets. It's a port of
    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/SherdJS/blob/master/sherdjs/src/bookmarklets/sherd.js">the bookmarklet</a> that's also in use right now. We're
    maintaining the collection code in both the bookmarklet and
    the extension. Eventually, it might make sense to move the common
    logic into a library, so it's more easily maintained.
  </p>

  <p>
    The way it works is, when you're on a page, say, Wikipedia, you
    click on either the bookmarklet button or the button for the Chrome
    extension. The code then looks for anything on the page that should
    be imported to Mediathread.
  </p>

  <p>
    My strategy for testing something like this comprises of both unit
    tests and tests that fetch example web pages we want to be compatible
    with to see if they have the expected structure. I don't have very
    many unit tests yet, but the basic ideas are here, for both test types:
