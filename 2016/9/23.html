            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments">dotfiles</a> 
            define settings in Unix environments, and have maintained 
            a certain importance throughout the past few decades for
            computer nerds around the world. There are lots of different
            things you can do in a dotfile.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make command aliases:
        </p>
        <pre>
alias s='git status'
alias d='git diff'
alias l='git log'

alias e='emacs -nw'
        </pre>
        <p>
            Maybe the alias needs to do something slightly different
            based on what operating system family you're using:
        </p>
        <pre>
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "linux-gnu" ]]; then
  alias ls='ls -F --color'
elif [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
  alias ls='ls -FG'
fi
        </pre>
        <p>
            For turning off my laptop's touchpad tap behavior,
            I have this script at <code>.bin/touchpad.sh</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
#!/usr/bin/env bash
synclient MaxTapTime=0
        </pre>
        <p>
            You could have a script called
            <a href="https://github.com/nikolas/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.bin/jcc">jcc</a>
            that submits a file to Google's JavaScript compiler. If
            you put that in your dotfile repository, you can now use
            this anywhere your dotfiles are installed without worrying
            about copying over this script itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, collections of dotfiles, and the contents of 
            these files, evolve slowly and steadily - particularly
            the often-used ones like <code>.bashrc</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To manage
            <a href="https://github.com/nikolas/dotfiles/tree/master/home">my dotfiles</a>,
            I chose to use a tool called
            <a href="https://github.com/andsens/homeshick">homeshick</a>
            because it only requires bash to be installed, no
            dependencies like python or ruby. It works for me, but
            I've always wondered if there's a better way to do it.
            The reasoning behind having a central place to store my
            dotfiles is that I can make a single change to be used on
            the handful of computers and servers I use regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't always want or need to clone my central dotfiles
            wherever I ssh to, though. I don't have them set up on
            cunix, because all I do here log in and use emacs to write
            blog entries once in a while. It would be nice to have the
            same emacs configuration that I use everywhere else when
            writing these posts, but the version of emacs on cunix is
            a few years old, and it just doesn't matter enough to put
            in the work of making my emacs configuration compatible
            with it.
