               >Feature Flags</a> are useful in our continuous deployment
            process at CTL. Using the same primary branch for development
            and production has many benefits, and feature flags allow us
            to hide certain aspects of the application that we don't
            want users to see yet, because it's not finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their use may seem obvious to most: just turn off a certain
            part of the template with a feature flag. Somehow, I found
            myself confounded at why I had made the decision four months 
            ago to use a feature flag to override an entire view in
            Mediathread:
        </p>
<pre>
class MethCourseManagerMiddleware(CourseManagerMiddleware):
    def process_request(self, request):
        override_view = None

        # When course_activation is turned on, use the 
        # MethCourseListView which has the course 
        # activation feature instead of courseaffils'
        # CourseListView.
        if waffle.flag_is_active(request, 'course_activation'):
            override_view = MethCourseListView

        return super(MethCourseManagerMiddleware, self).process_request(
            request, override_view)
</pre>
        <p>
            Because MethCourseListView is using a different template than
            the default, CourseListView, there's now two different templates
            being used, depending on the value of the feature flag. As a
            result, there was some strange behavior between what was 
            happening on development, production, and in selenium tests
            that was really not obvious without having the feature
            flag at the front of your mind.
            At the time, I thought this scheme was necessary. But looking 
            back, I could easily have just always overridden that view, and
            hid the feature in question (in this case, the course activation
            rows), in the template. That way, the same view logic is
            always being used and tested. Also, in the case that you
            forget about the flag, the diagnosis is, "the course 
            activation rows aren't showing up". That makes it much
            quicker to conclude that, "oh, the course activation
            feature flag must be turned off."
        </p>
        <p>
            So, my conclusion is that feature flags shouldn't introduce
            divergent code paths, or serve different templates.
            If possible, they should just be used to hide small portions
            of a template.
