        <p>
            At CTL, we have pieces of code being actively used in many
            obscure, hidden, and sometimes forgotten places throughout
            our own infrastructure and the larger
            university's. Recently I started working on a module for
            <a href="https://blackrock.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/portal/"
               >the Virtual Forest Initiative</a>, an application that 
            connects data from the 
            <a href="http://blackrockforest.org/">Block Rock Forest</a>
            west of the Hudson river just north of New York City.
        </p>
        <p>
            Part of this application involves downloading sensor data 
            collected by scientists at the forest. We periodically download 
            this data to a central Linux server called Cunix. We have Python
            2.6 available to us on this server, and the code used to download
            this data is in this repo:
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/blackrock_fetcher">blackrock_fetcher</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The module I'm working on graphs dendrometer data (a dendrometer is
            an instrument that measures the width of tree trunks to track
            their growth). After downloading the dendrometer's CSV data, I
            wanted to prepare the data in order to graph it in the best way.
            I chose to do this processing in the fetcher environment, instead
            of in the browser's front-end code. In addition to just making more
            sense to do this sort of preparation just once on the "back-end", I
            saw the challenge of making the code Python 2.6-compatible as 
            an added perk.
        </p>
        <p>
            My co-worker Anders has developed a
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/makefiles/blob/master/django.mk">Makefile-based scheme</a> 
            for bootstrapping virtualenvs in Python. With some minor adaptation
            I got this working in Python 2.6. It really just required adding an
            extra package - <code>argparse</code> in the
            <code>requirements/virtualenv_support</code> directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that I have a virtualenv, the
            <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">pypi</a> ecosystem is 
            available to me, and I'm not limited by the Python packages 
            installed on Cunix.
