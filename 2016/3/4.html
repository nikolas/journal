            I was working on a website scraper the other day and decided
            to write it in Haskell to re-familiarize myself with the
            language, and to learn about the http and html-related
            libraries available for Haskell. I have some things to
            work out with my code (right now, it hangs when loading
            the URL), but through this project I was reminded of
            some of the things that went through my head when I last
            used Haskell 6 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite thing about Haskell is the idea of being
            completely clear and explicit about the type of data
            you're passing throughout the program. To
            give an example about what I'm talking about, here's
            a function that takes a list of characters and returns
            the first one:
        </p>
<pre>
first :: [Char] -> Char
first s = s !! 0
</pre>
        <p>
            This function only ever accepts a list of Chars, and will only
            ever return a Char. Without including the first line of this
            function, the compiler infers a more general type for this
            function: <code>[a] -> a</code>. This function type uses the
            type variable <code>a</code> to say it takes a list of something,
            and returns a single instance of that same something.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dynamically typed languages like Python and JavaScript don't
            have these features built in to the language, but you can
            still take advantage of some of the benefits of writing
            clearly typed code. Once in a while I
            run into a Python or Javascript function that isn't
            obvious about what it accepts and returns. By adding some
            comments at the top of the function to document this info,
            in a similar style to Haskell's explicit typing mechanism,
            the function becomes more understandable to readers. Type
            errors become more obvious. For example,
            If I read that this Python function returns a string, then
            see a code path where it's possible for the function to
            finish without returning anything at all, I can fix that
            problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through that example I've alluded to a specific aim of
            functional programming: functions always return a value.
            By organizing your code as a network of
            stateless functions that each return a well-defined and
            predictable type of value, you can compose a reliable
            program. That's another idea from Haskell that can be
            taken advantage of in more flexible, imperative languages
            like Python and JavaScript. Imperative languages let you
            alter state and return different types of values via
            different code paths. It's often necessary to alter
            state in object-oriented code, but I try to keep the
            functional paradigm in mind when writing this kind of
            code, and at least be consistent about the return type.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2010, I stopped programming in Haskell and learned Ruby
            on Rails because that was the easiest way to get a job.
            So the Haskell community is small and not focused on web
            development. But there's a few other things that keep me
            from programming in Haskell on a regular basis. Its
            strict type system is both good and bad. Going back to
            my web scraper, here's a ghci session that displays the
            type of a Haskell library's <code>fromUrl</code> function,
            which takes a url and returns an HTML document. The
            <code>::</code> operator can be read as "is of the type".
        </p>
        <pre>
$ ghci
Prelude> import Text.HandsomeSoup
Prelude Text.HandsomeSoup> :t fromUrl
fromUrl
  :: String
     -> Text.XML.HXT.Arrow.XmlState.TypeDefs.IOSArrow
          b (Data.Tree.NTree.TypeDefs.NTree Text.XML.HXT.DOM.TypeDefs.XNode)
        </pre>
        <p>
            We see this function takes a String and returns something
            else. The string part makes sense - a string is how anyone would
            represent a URL. But what about the crazy return type? Why isn't
            this function type something  simple like
            <code>String -> XmlDocument</code>?
        </p>
        <p>
            That's the secret of Haskell. When you think about it, the
            <code>fromUrl</code> function needs to do some I/O work,
            changing the state of the system in this process.
            Invoking side effects (i.e. doing I/O work) goes against
            the ideas that Haskell is based on. In fact, in Haskell
            terms you'll hear of code that has side effects described
            with the derogatory word "impure".
            Haskell has dealt with this (making the impure code pure again)
            through some complicated math, ultimately
            coming up with the "Monad" type.
            For details on input/output in Haskell, see:
            <a href="https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/io.html"
               >https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/io.html</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In college I was lucky to have professors
            teach me about functional programming, specifically in Haskell.
            So I learned about monads, and I've heard that an
            <a href="https://www.haskell.org/arrows/">Arrow</a> is a type of
            monad. But I still can't really wrap my head around it.
            So that's as far as I can get off the top of my head into
            understanding the return type of <code>fromUrl</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            And whether you really understand this return type or not,
            you have to admit that it's still not obvious.
            By writing code that passes around complicated types,
            you create a complex program that takes up a lot of mental
            space.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, that's been my take on Haskell in my years of not using
            it. There's lots of good things to learn by writing
            code in a functional language. I assume that we can find
            useful ideas in other programming paradigms as well, such
            as logic programming in Prolog. That's more difficult,
            though. In my experience Prolog is way more different from
            imperative programming than Haskell.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also keep in mind that computers are
            procedural underneath it all, at the machine code level. In
            addition, think about the amazing complexity that the Linux
            kernel developers are able to manage through procedural C
            code. So in the future we may see functional or some other
            kind of programming become the norm, as programming
            languages themselves were invented as an abstraction of
            machine code. But who knows. We do think procedurally,
            and it's just second nature for instructions of a routine
            to come one after another, in contrast to the mathematical
            style of a function as a definition from one domain to another.
