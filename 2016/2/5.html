            This week I connected the bootstrap-datepicker JavaScript
            library's
            <a href="https://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/markup.html#date-range"
               >input-daterange</a> widget to PMT using a mixin, so it can
            easily be made to work with any view. The complete changes are
            in <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/dmt/pull/699">dmt#699</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As shown in the pull request, we already had the RangeOffsetMixin
            which allows users to specify the reported days using "range"
            and "offset" parameters. This worked and did everything we needed
            it to do. But it wasn't very intuitive: If I want a staff
            report for the month of December 2015, I find the right parameters
            through a procedure of trial and error (let's see..
            "range" will be 31 because I think December has 31
            days, and "offset" will be around 35 + 31 because right
            now it's February 5th, and December 1st was a little over two
            months ago). Because we think in terms of calendar dates, not
            durations and offsets of days, Maurice suggested we allow the
            users to pick this range using a datepicker like we use
            to pick an action item's due date. I thought this was a great
            idea that we should have come up with sooner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, the same JavaScript library we're using to pick due
            dates has a "daterange" mode:
            <a href="https://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/markup.html#date-range"
               >input-daterange</a>. After changing the interface in PMT's
            reports templates, I just needed to connect the view to look at
            these new form parameters on submit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've adapted the old <code>RangeOffsetMixin</code> into a
            <code>DaterangeMixin</code>. <code>RangeOffsetMixin</code>
            calculates dates using a <code>calc_interval()</code> method,
            which I assumed was no longer necessary: the user is now
            picking absolute, not relative, points of time, simplifying
            the server's date calculation job. This is a nice situation
            where a more user-friendly interface also lends to simpler
            code.
        </p>
        <p>
            It turns out that there is still some calculation to do
            that's worth separating from <code>get_params()</code>.
            I still need to combine
            <code>interval_start</code> and
            <code>interval_end</code> dates with
            <code>datetime.min.time()</code> and
            <code>datetime.max.time()</code> respectively for the range
            to be accurate. The results of these combinations are
            timezone-naive, so I then need to convert them to
            timezone-aware dates as we were doing before.

            So the code isn't as simple as I hoped, but I think it can be
            improved. I'm going through extra, possibly redundant, steps to
            make sure <code>interval_start</code> or
            <code>interval_end</code> never fall back to something that the
            user might not expect: an example of complicated code actually
            yielding a more user-friendly experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~njn2118/journal/2016/1/8.html"
               >I mentioned before</a> that complicated code isn't as
            satisfying to end up with as brief, clear code. I think that's
            because as more happens in our own code, a few things come along
            with that. The room for error increases, and the amount of code
            that you need to read, understand, and maintain increases.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the relationship between code and interface is interesting
            when I'm reminded that code has its own interfaces, and is itself
            an interface to our computers. Is "simplicity" of Django code
            less important than I think it is? After all, this is an
            arbitrarily opinionated web framework built on Python and its
            arbitrarily opinionated standard libraries. Well that's the open
            question of this post and in the meantime we have
            <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mccabe">mccabe</a> to keep
            our code complexity in check.
