            Now that I've made some progress on
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/juxtapose">Juxtapose</a>
            I wanted to review some of the pieces and decisions I've 
            made when putting this together. There are some differences
            between what I'm using here and what we've used for other
            JavaScript projects at CTL.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the <code>src</code> directory, there's a mix of 
            <code>.js</code> and <code>.jsx</code> files. I'm using
            <code>.jsx</code> when there's jsx templating in the file,
            which allows Emacs to automatically indent these sections
            correctly using <a href="http://web-mode.org/">web-mode</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've chosen to use the newer ecmascript 6 JavaScript syntax, 
            made possible by <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>.
            You'll see the string <code>es2015</code> in
            <code>.babelrc</code> and <code>.eslintrc</code> - this denotes
            features added to ecmascript 6 in 2015, which turn out to
            be the essential ones I've been using, like import / export / 
            class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because I'm using a newer JavaScript syntax, jshint had trouble
            with this code. It turns out most people are using eslint instead of
            jshint for this, so I'm using that as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testing is done with
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a> - I figured
            it would be the most straight-forward to use because Facebook
            specifically built it to test React applications. It's just
            a unit-testing framework though, like QUnit or Mocha.
        </p>
        <p>
            A key concept about making a React application is the balance 
            of "state" vs "props". This was covered in 
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-4-identify-where-your-state-should-live">Thinking in React</a>, and the guideline is to
            identify which components depend on which pieces of state,
            and put that state in one place: the nearest common parent.
            In my application that turns out to be the root class:
            <code>JuxtaposeApplication</code>.
