            The Mediathread team has been laying out plans for a video 
            sequencing tool to be used as part of Mediathread, and now it's 
            time to actually start putting it together.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea for the tool is to have two side-by-side visual
            tracks playing at the same time. The left track displays
            a video playing from start to finish. The right track displays
            videos, images, or pieces of text, which are queued up by the user 
            in a timeline interface. YouTube's annotation editor is the 
            closest idea I've seen on the web to what we want to
            build, but I'm sure there are others that I'm not aware of.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the past few months I've been thinking I'll just develop this
            with rigorously structured plain JavaScript, using a small
            collection of libraries instead of an actual framework. As I
            got closer to the prototyping stage, I kept thinking about all
            the little pieces of data and interface cues that I'll need to
            keep in sync, a lot like the
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/wacep/tree/master/media/WeatherRoulette"
               >WeatherRoulette</a> game in WACEP. Obviously, I want this
            tool to be stable, and I've had luck with Ember in the past
            when working on interactive front-end applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was pretty sure I didn't want to use Ember. I like Ember,
            but it's a Rails-style "opinionated" framework, which is 
            great when starting up a new project, but I want
            this video tool to be tightly integrated into Mediathread.
            I talked to someone at PyCon in Portland who reminded me
            that <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> 
            strives to be easily integrated into any web 
            stack. It's really just a way of organizing the application
            into components in a declarative fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I've bitten the bullet and started experimenting with React.
            My learning process was: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Read <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html"
                        >Thinking in React</a>, and skim over the React 
                documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Download and try out the code in the
                <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html"
                   >React Starter Kit</a>
                to see how all the pieces fit together, what's required
                to deploy the application, and what options I had regarding
                that process.
            </li>
            <li>
                Copy one of the example apps to a new directory and create
                some components for the video tool, then get everything
                to communicate with each other to get the behavior I want.

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The results of my final step are in a GitHub repo
            <a href="https://github.com/nikolas/juxtapose">here</a>,
            including stuff that I've so far only had peripheral knowledge
            of, like "babel," "webpack," and "jsx".
        </p>
        <p>
            My process has been productive. I can use the basic
            structure of my prototype whether or not I choose to go
            with React during the rest of development. I've been 
            reminded of how nice it is to work with a
            framework that automatically updates template
            variables based on the state of the system, like Ember
            but unlike Backbone. So I plan on continuing my React
            development until I run into any major problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm developing my prototype outside of Mediathread,
            keeping in mind I'll need to bring it back in to
            the larger application. In order to queue up new
            pieces of media, I'll need to call Mediathread's
            collection pop-up to display the current collection
            to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will probably need to use Mediathread's SherdJS
            abstraction layer to talk to the YouTube and Vimeo
            APIs through a uniform interface.
            Interestingly, it looks like with some minor hacks you
            can play
            <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/21550559/173630">Vimeo</a> and
            <a href="http://mediaelementjs.com/examples/?name=youtube">YouTube</a>
            videos with the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag! I haven't tried
            this out myself, but if that worked consistently, it would
            eliminate the work and complexity of connecting SherdJS
            to our new juxtaposition tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've added an iframe to the prototype below that I'll
            keep up to date as I make progress.
        </p>
        <iframe 
             style="margin-left: -100px"
             width="700" height="600" 
             src="http://nikolas.us.to/~nik/juxtapose/"></iframe>
