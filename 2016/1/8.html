            Selenium tests are notoriously annoying and
            unstable. There are just so many layers that affect the
            state of the system when booting up the full application
            and browser. In general, I try to make tests at the
            lowest, simplest level possible.  If something can be
            tested without loading any Django code, like a utility
            function, test it independently. Or if something can be
            tested on the model, test it there. Otherwise, make a view
            test. At the final step of this outward spiral, you can
            instantiate the entire application and automate a web
            browser to emulate a user visiting the site, clicking
            links and filling out form fields. We use Selenium to
            automate web browsers for testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, I do think Selenium-style tests are useful
            and essential. We've made giant refactors and upgrades to
            Mediathread's JavaScript code that would be tedious and
            intimidating without the intricate suite of Lettuce tests
            we have set up.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's been some recent discussion on the problem of
            Selenium-style testing.
            <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2015/07/21/selenium-7-things-you-need-to-know-2/"
               >Selenium: 7 Things You Need To Know</a> provides some
            tips on what you can do to reduce flakiness and
            streamline the process of writing Selenium tests.
            Last November there was the Google Tech Talk
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmk1h40shaE"
               >Your Tests Aren't Flaky</a>, proposing the idea that
            these "flaky" Selenium tests are really just symptoms of a
            flaky application, and should be considered bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my experience, in general, flaky Selenium tests mean the tests
            are flaky, not the application. But I appreciate the ideas
            of the "Your Tests Aren't Flaky" talk, and in that spirit I've made
            some attempts to fix a
            <a href="https://travis-ci.org/ccnmtl/worth2/builds/81979378#L685"
               >flaky test</a> in WORTH. My first step was to look at the tools
            we were using with our behave/selenium setup for Django. I realized
            <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/splinter">splinter</a>'s role
            was not essential: these programmatic browser commands could just
            as well be called directly from Selenium. It was only adding
            complexity to an already complex system. After refactoring behave
            to use Selenium's API instead of splinter's, I just added a bunch
            of extra-cautious code to WORTH's
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/worth2/blob/master/features/steps/common.py"
               >steps/common.py</a>. I was able to get this working
            reliably (so far) without using any arbitrary calls to
            <code>time.sleep()</code> after reading through the
            <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/py/index.html"
               >Selenium Python documentation</a>, and also some
            <a href="http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/"
               >unofficial Selenium Python documentation</a> that turned
            out to be really useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've managed to make the selenium tests more reliable by
            implementing more complicated code. That's not all that
            satisfying, so this is still a work in progress.
            At the moment I'm still having trouble converting the
            UELC tests from splinter to Selenium in the same way.
