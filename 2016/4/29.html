            I've been working on porting the changes from version 0.25 of
            <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark.js">commonmark.js</a>
            to Python. 0.25 introduces an abstract renderer
            class inherited by the HtmlRenderer. These new classes are in
            <code>render/html.js</code> and <code>render/renderer.js</code>.
            I'm trying to keep the Python code as similar to the JavaScript
            code as possible for maintainability, and I ran into some
            exasperating problems with my new <code>render/html.py</code>
            and <code>render/renderer.py</code> files.
        </p>
        <p>
            CommonMark-py has a custom test runner called
            <code>run_spec_tests.py</code> that hooks up to
            commonmark's implementation-independent <code>spec.txt</code>
            file. Here's what the beginning of my debugging process was
            like:
        </p>
<pre>
$ ./venv/bin/python setup.py test
running test
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "CommonMark/tests/run_spec_tests.py", line 10, in <module>
    from CommonMark.render.html import HtmlRenderer
ImportError: No module named 'CommonMark.render'            
</pre>
        <p>
            So, I've seen this error in the past, and it's meant that
            <code>render/__init__.py</code> doesn't exist.
            That's the first thing I checked, but it was already there
            so that didn't fix it.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's a bunch of strangeness around debugging this problem.
            For example, I can import <code>CommonMark.render</code> in
            the Python shell, and also the actual class I need to
            get at from the tests:
        </p>
<pre>
$ ./venv/bin/python setup.py install
running install
  ... 

$ ./venv/bin/python
Python 3.5.1+ (default, Mar 30 2016, 22:46:26) 
[GCC 5.3.1 20160330] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import CommonMark.render
>>> 
>>> from CommonMark.render.html import HtmlRenderer
>>> 
</pre>
        <p>
            If I put an ipdb breakpoint before the import statement,
            I can also import <code>CommonMark.render</code>. But if I try
            this in a plain pdb breakpoint, I do get the error.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been debugging this with Python 3.5 but the library's also
            compatible with Python 2.7, and I get the same error with Python
            2.7. Here's the branch I'm working on:
            <a href="https://github.com/rtfd/CommonMark-py/commits/spec-0.25"
               >https://github.com/rtfd/CommonMark-py/commits/spec-0.25</a>
            I guess I should really open a StackOverflow question, since I
            haven't solved the problem yet.
