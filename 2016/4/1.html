            There's a book called
            <a href="https://archive.org/stream/BuildingMaintainableSoftwareSIG/"
               >Building Maintainable Software</a>, which I need to read at
            some point. I would argue that (and maybe the book already covers

                <li>Who wrote this code?</li>
                <li>What is the code doing?</li>
            </ul>

            Some unmaintainable software I've written:

            For example, 10 years ago, how could you have known that
            MochiKit would fail, and jQuery would succeed and continue
            to be developed today?
