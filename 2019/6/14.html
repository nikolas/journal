                    What do I like about the internet and free
                    software?  The idea that things can be sustainable
                    and maintained, and be around for maybe even forever.
                    I'm not excited about new developments in
                    technology, business, etc.  Rather, I just like
                    finding software I like: Audacity, Mixxx, Xmonad,
                    that's alive and always open to a deeper
                    understanding for anyone who desires. Each program
                    is its own world of knowledge.  If you want to
                    spend a weekend learning how video codecs are put
                    together in VLC, you're free to do that.  And I
                    mean, who wouldn't want to be able to
                    play <a href="https://www.openttd.org">OpenTTD</a>
                    in 20 years?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software is alive and constantly changes based on
                    how it's being used. So if you like a project, you
                    can help out by fixing things up and helping it
                    along.  I've found graphics kind of interesting
                    lately, so I've been learning about various
                    graphical systems on the web related to my job, as
                    well as <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>,
                    a widely used cross-platform development library
                    that handles graphics output.  OpenTTD uses SDL
                    1.2: it's not a pressing concern, but this will be
                    deprecated at some point in favor of the new SDL
                    2.0. So I went through the
                    <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/MigrationGuide">SDL
                    2 Migration Guide</a> and did my best to apply
                    these changes to OpenTTD.
                    The <a href="https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/pull/7086">pull
                    request</a> has been open for six months and has
                    gone through lots of changes and feedback. I've
                    learned about OpenTTD's
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitter">pixel
                    blitters</a> and the process that graphics go
                    through, from an idea in the code to animation on
                    the screen.
                </p>

                    I've done my best to understand the insides of
                    OpenTTD. MaiZure made a nice overview of this
                    program last August:
                    <a href="http://www.maizure.org/projects/decoded-openttd/index.html">Decoded: OpenTTD</a>.
                    What have I learned through all this? I already
                    knew programming is complicated. But when you have
                    a specific goal in mind, and you can visualize
                    that goal and start piecing together the
                    connections in your mind, it's definitely within
                    reach. And also, I can't imagine what the source
                    code for
                    <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a>
                    looks like. I'll have to write a post about that
                    another time.
