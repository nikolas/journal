                    <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a>
                    is a tool for managing and encrypting secrets. It's used
                    as a daemon, running on a server, that needs to be active
                    in order for these encrypted secrets to be read. I've been
                    cleaning a few things up with a vault service I'm using:
                    fixing a graphite connection error that caused vault.log
                    to grow to over 1gb, setting up log rotation for this log
                    file and vault_audit.log, and just some routine upgrades
                    of the Vault software itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you make changes like this to Vault, it has the tendency
                    to "seal" itself. This is a security measure that requires a few
                    separate keys to "unseal" into a mode where Vault can again
                    read out secrets for you. Because of this, making changes to
                    Vault can be scary: What if I lose all my secrets?
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's still a place in this world for 
                    <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=26821">plain text files</a> and
                    <a href="https://xkcd.com/2176/">password books</a>.
                    As a safeguard, I decided to just save all my
                    vault secrets in a plain text file, and keep it
                    somewhere physically secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following that path led me 
                    <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/111">here</a>,
                    and since Vault doesn't have a "print out all the secrets" command,
                    I needed to do some basic shell scripting.
                    Use this <a href="https://gist.github.com/mazenovi/db8e8efb001d45059a6102fa4e241688">vault-tree</a>
                    script to print out the full path of each secret
                    in your vault tree. Then make another script
                    that takes each line and runs <code>vault read</code>
                    on it:
                </p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# read_vault_secrets.sh
#

while read path; do
    vault read -format=json "$path"
done < $1
</pre>
                <p>
                    Using these scripts together, you can do something
                    like this:
                </p>
                <pre>
./vault-tree > my_vault_tree.txt
./read_vault_secrets.sh my_vault_tree.txt > vault_secrets.txt
                </pre>
            </div>
