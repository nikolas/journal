                    I recently made a "course-cloning" feature in
                    <a href="https://econpractice.ctl.columbia.edu/">EconPractice</a> that provides new instructors with
                    their own template course. The original master
                    course is managed by Tom Groll. This will give new
                    instructors some ideas on how EconPractice can be
                    used, and what scenarios it was designed for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A course is represented in Django with the <code>Course</code> model.
                    This model has many <code>Topic</code> instances, which in turn
                    have many <code>Graph</code> instances. I want to create a copy of
                    each topic and graph whenever this course is cloned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python has a
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/copy.html">copy</a>
                    library that can be used to copy Python
                    objects. But Django model instances have even more
                    to them than a Python object, because they
                    represent what's saved in a database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The recommended way to copy Django model instances
                    is to use <code>copy()</code>, then set the instance's
                    primary key to <code>None</code>, and save it. To clone
                    a Graph instance, it's pretty simple:
                </p>
<pre>
class Graph(models.Model):
    def clone(self):
        g = copy.copy(self)
        g.pk = None
        g.save()
        return g
</pre>
                <p>
                    To clone the whole course, I have to deal with the
                    relations of the course manually. Because Django
                    doesn't know that I want to clone all the course's
                    topics and graphs, but not some relations like,
                    for example, the users.
                </p>
<pre>
# Course is called Cohort here (it's just a more general 
# term for a course).
class Cohort(models.Model):
    def clone(self):
        c = copy.copy(self)
        c.pk = None
        c.is_sample = None
        c.save()

        # Clone the topics.
        for topic in self.topic_set.all():
            if topic.name == 'General':
                # The General topic is created automatically in the
                # post_save hook.
                cloned_topic = c.get_general_topic()
            else:
                cloned_topic = Topic.objects.create(cohort=c, name=topic.name)

            for graph in topic.graph_set.all():
                cloned_graph = graph.clone()
                cloned_graph.topic = cloned_topic
                cloned_graph.save()

        return c
