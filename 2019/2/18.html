                    Three.js provides the
                    <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane">Plane</a>
                    concept for representing two dimensional surfaces
                    that extend infinitely in 3d space. This is useful for
                    <a href="https://discourse.threejs.org/t/finding-nearest-vertex-of-a-mesh-to-mouse-cursor/4167">cursor interaction</a>
                    so you might need to learn how to set up this plane,
                    visualize it, and adjust it as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three.js's <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane">Plane
                    documentation</a> is good and accurate, but it
                    definitely assumes you're a "math person" (which
                    I'm not), and doesn't explain how to get things
                    working if you've never heard of things like
                    quaternions and plane normals. I've had to learn
                    about these things the good old-fashioned hard
                    way, and so I've put together this guide for other
                    developers like me just getting into 3d graphics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, it's good to get an intuitive feel for
                    what a plane is: how would you represent a
                    plane in 3d space? I suppose you could define any
                    plane using 3 points, creating a triangle that
                    extends infinitely along its surface. It wouldn't
                    matter what size the triangle is: the plane is
                    still the same as long as its slope is the same.
                    Here's a Blender scene to help visualize that:
                </p>
                <img src="img/plane1.png" alt="A small triangle in 3d space" />
                <img src="img/plane2.png" alt="A bigger triangle, with the same slope and position as the first one." />
                <p>
                    So, representing the plane as a collection of
                    three points can definitely work, but maybe there's
                    an even better way to represent this structure.
                    There's a concept called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)">surface normal</a>,
                    which is a vector (i.e., an arrow pointing out in
                    a certain direction) that is perpendicular from a
                    surface. Here's an image from Wikipedia showing
                    a surface with two normal vectors (a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Vector3">vector</a> consists of three parameters: x, y, and z):
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img/Normal_vectors2.svg" 
                         style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;"
                         alt="A plane and two of its normal vectors." />
                </p>
                <p>
                    And here's an illustration of surface normals for
                    a curved surface:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img/Surface_normals.svg" 
                         style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;"
                         alt="Normal vectors for the surface xe^{-x^{2}-y^{2}}." />
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can imagine a flat plane for each of those normals, like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img/Surface_normal_illustration.svg" 
                         style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;"
                         alt="A normal to a surface at a point is the same as a normal to the tangent plane to the same surface at the same point." />
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the way that three.js's Plane is put
                    together, clearly visible in its constructor:
                </p>
                <pre>
Plane( normal : Vector3, constant : Float )

  normal - (optional) a unit length Vector3 defining the normal of the
      plane. Default is (1, 0, 0).
  constant - (optional) the signed distance from the origin to the
      plane. Default is 0.
                </pre>
                <p>
                    So to set up a plane facing straight
                    up, you can do something like this:
                </p>
<pre>
var myPlane = new THREE.Plane(new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0), 0);
</pre>
                <p>
                    The normal vector is pointing up because y has a
                    value, and it's not pulled toward the x or z
                    directions at all.  In fact, if you set the normal
                    vector to (0, 2, 0) or (0, 200, 0) you get the
                    exact same plane, because what's important with a
                    normal vector is its direction, not its
                    magnitude. The constant value of 0 means that this
                    plane is centered right at the scene's center
                    point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the way, by default this plane will be invisible in
                    your three.js scene. To see it, you connect a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/helpers/PlaneHelper">PlaneHelper</a> to it.
                    This might get confusing, but if your goal is to actually
                    draw this surface for the user to see then you would use a
                    <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/PlaneGeometry">PlaneGeometry</a>,
                    which inherits all its basic methods from
                    <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D">Object3D</a>.
                    The <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane">Plane</a> class that
                    I'm talking about in this article is just a mathematical plane, but you need
                    to use this sort of plane in order to use <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Ray.intersectPlane">Ray.intersectPlane()</a>, which is how you connect up mouse events to
                    a flat plane in three.js.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, now you know how to initialize the plane, and
                    basically move it around. What if you need to
                    rotate this thing? Well, you can always just
                    change the parameters in the plane's normal
                    vector, right?  That's actually a really difficult
                    way to work with planes, though. If you need to
                    match this plane's rotation with a visible
                    object's rotation that's already in the scene, or
                    just apply something like a 45-degree rotation
                    offset, messing around with the normal vector
                    might be frustrating.
                    I'll go over some basic patterns for rotating this
                    plane using a few tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You're going to need to learn how to work with
                    <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Quaternion">quaternions</a>.
                    They seem really complicated, but all you need to
                    know is that they're a set of coordinates that
                    define a three.js object's current rotation state,
                    and every Object3D has one. You can use three.js's
                    API to apply changes to quaternions and modify
                    them to do what you need to do.
                </p>
                <pre>
// There's an object in the scene - myObject - and
// I want to take its rotation and make my plane
// have the same rotation.
var rotation = myObject.quaternion.clone();

// The default forward vector for 3D objects is (0, 0, 1),
// so first set the normal to match myObject like that,
// and then make the plane's rotation match myObject as well.
myPlane.normal.set(0, 0, 1).applyQuaternion(rotation);
                </pre>
                <p>
                    You can also make any changes to this quaternion
                    that you need before you apply it to the plane. Say
                    you need a 90 degree offset on this rotation:
                </p>
                <pre>
var offset = new THREE.Quaternion();

offset.setFromAxisAngle(
    // This rotation offset is along the X axis,
    // so use a vector where X is 1 here.
    new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0), 

    // Offset by -90 degrees (in radians)
    -Math.PI / 2);

// Modify the rotation
rotation.multiply(offset);

// The 'rotation' quaternion is now ready to be applied to the plane
                </pre>
                <p>
                    I know, it seems like a lot of rigamarole for some
                    simple rotations.
                    Just think of it as another pattern in your toolkit.
                    In fact, adding some simple rotation mechanism to three.js's
                    Plane API has
                    <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/10923">been discussed</a>.
                    The math behind the reason you can't rotate a Plane the same way as an Object3D
                    is a little beyond me, but it sounds like it's because Plane doesn't have
                    a "local coordinate system".
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this post has been kind of dense. But I hope
                    it's helpful for anyone jumping into this area of
                    three.js. And also this can be seen as a testament
                    to abstraction: it's really possible to make 3D
                    graphics work for your needs without understanding
                    all the math behind it, and little by little you
                    get a feel for working with vectors, and the various
                    coordinate systems, etc.
