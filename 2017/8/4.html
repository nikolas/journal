            I'm actually a
            well-adjusted <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>
            user, which are few and far between. It's now been 4 years
            since I moved to New York and started using Emacs as my
            text editor for development. Here I'll go through parts of
            my impression so far about Emacs compared to Vim when used
            for programming, and some of my favorite extensions and
            parts of my configuration in Emacs.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I think about opening a file in Vim, my muscle memory
            hesitates for a moment - what if I need to open another
            file? As a Vim user, I had used
            <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NERDtree</a>
            to browse my directory tree and navigate through files. I
            appreciate NERDtree's visual layout because I think of
            myself as a visual person. The problem of opening files
            and navigating between them can be solved in many ways, in
            Vim and Emacs, and I've found that Vim's solutions often
            involve random extensions, and it just feels less
            orthogonal and well-designed than navigation in
            Emacs. This is the main reason why I like using Emacs
            when working on anything involving more than one
            file. Using <code>C-x C-f</code> opens the minibuffer that
            allows you to type anything, has good tab completion, and
            always works as expected.
            The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minibuffer-File.html#Minibuffer-File">minibuffer</a>
            in Emacs is a central feature that I can't do without, for
            now. From there I'll often split the window with <code>C-x
            3</code> or <code>C-x 2</code>, and maybe switch one pane
            to the the previous buffer with <code>C-x b</code>. The
            process is simpler and quicker than what I've found using
            the <code>:o</code> command in Vim. Notably, I no longer
            rely on a perpetual visual directory layout, but always
            have the option to open the directory with <code>C-x
            C-f</code> if I need to look around.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that if you use a text editor, IDE or whatever,
            you should be able to use it with its default settings
            without that much inconvenience to your muscle memory. So
            like, the less crazy extensions and command customizations
            you have, the better.
        </p>

            <a href="http://www.isaacezer.com/">An old co-worker</a>,
            when we were both learning Emacs, introduced me to the
            Emacs extension that I still use the most:
            <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NumberedWindows">window-number-mode</a>.
            Without <code>window-number-mode</code> installed, I can
            use the Emacs default <code>C-x o</code> just fine. But I'll
            admit that I have gotten used to switching between panes with
            <code>M-1</code>, <code>M-2</code>, <code>M-3</code>, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another customization I'll admit to using is a key
            shortcut to go to a specific line number:
        </p>
        <pre>
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c g") 'goto-line)
        </pre>
        <p>
            And pretty often, I'll use
            this <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Abbrevs.html">abbrev</a>
            I've defined to insert a pdb breakpoint. Instead of typing
            out the whole thing I'll just type <code>pdb</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
(define-abbrev global-abbrev-table "pdb"
  "from ipdb import set_trace; set_trace()")
        </pre>
        <p>
            There are a few other extensions I regularly use,
            including <a href="https://github.com/purcell/whitespace-cleanup-mode">whitespace-cleanup-mode</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter">git-gutter</a>. No
            doubt, extensions like this are available for Vim as well.
            But unlike Vim, Emacs has a built-in
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Packages.html">package
            manager</a>.
