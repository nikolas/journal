            In <a href="./1.html">my previous
            post</a> I'm all excited about Vega, a way to represent
            data visualizations in a JSON structure. But as I
            half-expected, I'm actually going in a different direction
            now. I've discovered that there's a difference between
            data-driven visualization libraries like Vega, (and d3.js,
            after all, stands for data-driven documents), and dynamic
            math libraries like
            <a href="http://jsxgraph.org">JSXGraph</a>. Everything
            I've seen in the data-driven libraries expects a data set
            that can then be displayed in many possible ways. In
            contrast, you can tell JSXGraph to create two points, then
            create a circle or line connected to those two points, and
            everything is draggable by default. This is similar to
            another library I was considering but haven't
            tried: <a href="https://two.js.org/">two.js</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I've pretty much realized that Vega's JSON structure isn't
            a necessary enough property to make up for what it lacks,
            which JSXGraph has: built-in interactive geometry features.
            Here's a demand-supply graph that has dotted lines stuck
            perpendicular at the axes to the two lines' intersection.
            As flexible as d3/vega seem to be, this kind of thing
            seems to be easier in JSXGraph. As far as storing the
            configuration options to create these graphs, I'm sure
            I'll figure something out.
