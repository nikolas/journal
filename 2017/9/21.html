            There's so much I like about React: new ECMAScript
            features, declarative program structure, patchy yet
            sufficient documentation. Okay, the only React-specific
            thing there is the declarative program structure -
            automatic view rendering based on the relation between
            state and props. You can use ESnext wherever you want to
            set up babel (becoming less and less necessary) and
            webpack, and lots of projects have good documentation. But
            my point is, I have drunk the React kool-aid. So far, I've
            only skimmed over the docs for
            <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, and if that ends
            up taking over, I'm fine with that. It seems similar
            enough to React at first glance.
        </p>

            For many React apps, you will want to communicate with a
            server through a REST api. At the CTL we primarily use
            Python and Django for custom web apps, so I'm
            using <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/">django-rest-framework</a>.
            That's what I mean by "Embedded React Application". As
            opposed to a single-page JavaScript application like
            Ember really embraced a few years ago
            (I'm not sure if that's different now, I haven't looked),
            I'm making React components that communicate with a
            surrounding Django application.  This is also how we
            developed
            Mediathread's <a href="http://mediathread.info/content/spring-2017-new-sequence-assignment-type-launches">Sequence
            Assignment</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently I used a new project I'm developing as an
            opportunity to try out the new
            <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>
            utility, which I was skeptical about, but had incorrectly
            thought that's now the recommended way to work with React
            applications, so I will just go with the flow. I was
            annoyed that the commands to start, test, and build my
            application were all delegated to
            a <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts">react-scripts</a>
            tool that didn't provide any help, info, or flexibility.

            I also led myself into a roadblock when trying to develop
            my React app within Django:
            <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/3156">Where
            is bundle.js on the filesystem?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, you can
            <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject">eject</a>
            from the create-react-app way, which removes the
            react-scripts dependency from your package.json and adds
            all the dependencies and configuration files that
            react-scripts uses to your project, so you can make
            changes more directly. I was really satisfied with this
            and was able to start developing in React/Django quickly
            after copying the <code>prod</code> webpack config
            to <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/econplayground.js/blob/master/config/webpack.config.dev.js">webpack.config.dev.js</a>,
            making some small changes to remove prod references and
            filename hashes, and making an <code>npm run dev</code> command:
        </p>
<pre>
"dev": "webpack -d --watch --config config/webpack.config.dev.js",
</pre>
        <p>
            So now, the workflow I used once for Mediathread becomes
            more standard as I try it on a new project:
        </p>
<pre>
cd djangoapp
rm media/djangoapp/bundle.js
ln -s ~/public_html/reactapp/build/bundle.js media/djangoapp/bundle.js
make runserver
</pre>
        <p>
            ... while webpack builds bundle.js in development mode,
            watching my files as I edit them. And someday that won't
            be necessary, maybe. I feel like I've typed this before,
            but JavaScript engine functionality has caught up with
            ECMAScript standards. Now what's missing is packages and
            imports in JavaScript - the focus of endless developments
            in the last 7 years. Or is that already here in the
            standards? Maybe I only have parts of the picture.

            I would invite you to comment below, but my disqus code
            was injecting malware. I just removed it instead of
            bothering to fix it. My email's on the main page here.
