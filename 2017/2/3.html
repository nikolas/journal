            When I've found it necessary to make changes to the npm libraries
            I'm using in React, the process isn't well-documented and I've found
            some guidelines through trial and error. To start, note that npm
            parses github repositories in <code>package.json</code>, and you
            can specify a branch with <code>#</code>, like this:
        </p>
<pre>
    "react-grid-layout": "ccnmtl/react-grid-layout#dev",
    "react-player": "ccnmtl/react-player#new-vimeo-api",
</pre>
        <p>
            Start with that, and then solve the problems as they come up.
            If you get errors saying the module isn't found, it probably
            needs to be built. Each node module is allowed to define its
            own build process, and can rely on any number of dependencies
            and build tools, like webpack, broccoli, babel, etc. I've been
            dealing with this in my own <code>Makefile</code>:
        </p>
<pre>
$(JS_SENTINAL): package.json
    rm -rf $(NODE_MODULES)
    npm install
    cd $(NODE_MODULES)/react-grid-layout && npm install && make build-js
    cd $(NODE_MODULES)/react-player && npm install && npm run build:webpack
    touch $(JS_SENTINAL)
</pre>
        <p>
            So any time my dependencies get installed, we go through each
            forked library's custom build process. I've found this pattern
            to be reliable so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll admit that this configuration does seem a little ad hoc.
            I'm expecting things to change, either as the inevitable pace
            of JavaScript/node.js progress sweeps along, or as I learn more
            about the npm ecosystem. For example, could this be simpler if
            I was using <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</a> instead of 
            npm?
        </p>
        <p>
            If your build is still failing, you might also need to
            give the library's <code>.npmignore</code> file some
            attention. Library authors tend to add the library's
            source directory to their <code>.npmignore</code> because
            it's not necessary to distribute the sources when using
            pre-built dist files. I've made the choice to build these
            libraries along with the package that's using them, but
            you could just as well pre-build the distribution files
            and commit the compiled code. I like to leave that step up
            to the library authors, though, and it also creates
            unwieldy diffs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In react-player I have to remove
            <code>src</code> and <code>webpack.config.*.js</code> from
            its
            <code>.npmignore</code>, and in react-grid-layout I've had
            to remove the <code>lib</code> directory. Again, these are
            ad hoc solutions to a problem that's not yet fully solved.
            The npm team gives a good overview of the state of things, at least,
            as it was in 2014, in their blog post:
            <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/101775448305/npm-and-front-end-packaging"
