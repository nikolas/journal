            We've uncovered a problem related to volume in
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/juxtapose/">Juxtapose</a>.
            In the following screenshot, the video still in the top
            right corresponds to the clip that the playhead is inside.
        </p>

            The volume for this video plays, as expected, on
            playthrough. But what happens when we pause the sequence
            and move the playhead slightly before the clip?
        </p>

        <p>
            Now the state of the sequence player is paused, and you
            wouldn't expect anything to be happening. But the
            music video I've loaded in this clip has started playing
            over the speakers even though it's not visible. I can see
            how this might be happening, because of how I've
            implemented the secondary videos which I'll explain later.
            But the problem is deeper than my investigations have so
            far reached, so I decided to write about it. Sometimes if
            you just methodically go over something step by step, the
            answer comes to you. I remember a handful of times when
            I've taken a half hour to type out a StackOverflow
            question, only to discover the answer myself once I put
            the complete question into words.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to display different clips of YouTube and Vimeo
            videos right after one another, the sequence tool
            instantiates each player instance it will need as soon as
            we know what video elements that sequence contains. So in
            the sequence above, there are three react-player
            instances. I'm using a wrapper class called 
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/juxtapose/blob/master/src/AVPlayer.jsx"
               >AVPlayer</a>, in which the ReactPlayer is created.
            The player gets primed (<code>playing</code> set to true)
            a few seconds before it appears in the user's display
            area, as a rough estimate to account for the time it will
            take to initialize. This priming process seems to be a
            piece of what causes this bug, because it doesn't occur
            when the playhead is over two seconds before the next
            video clip. Using the React Developer Tools browser
            extension, I can see that the <code>volume</code> prop
            passed from AVPlayer to ReactPlayer, as well as its child
            <code>YouTube</code> component, is 0 as expected. This
            shouldn't be happening, because this is exactly why I like
            using a library like React: the component's props dictate
            its behavior, always, and that's it. It's possible we've
            uncovered a bug in react-player, so now I'm looking at
            react-player's YouTube code to see how
            <code>setVolume()</code> gets called.
