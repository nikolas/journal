            In Unix, there's
            a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_(Unix)">write</a>
            command that lets you send messages to other users logged
            in to the system.  In Debian, a version of this command is
            included in the
            <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/bsdmainutils">bsdmainutils</a>
            package. I'm lucky enough to know people that like to
            communicate with me this way.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a known bug that <code>write</code> only supports the
            basic characters that are part
            of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ascii</a>.
            So you can't use the special characters of different
            languages like Danish or Spanish.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            The write utility does not recognize multibyte characters.
            <br /><br />
            <small>&mdash;from write's man page</small>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            You can fix this by changing the character buffer to use a multi-byte type
            instead of the old-school 8-bit <code>char</code>.
            Details are <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=876557#10">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are still some improvements that I need to make with this
            patch. <code>wchar_t</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_character#C.2FC.2B.2B">isn't
            ideal</a> for UTF-8 data, though it works. Apparently it's
            better (i.e. possibly more portable in the long run) to
            use <code>char16_t</code> or <code>char32_t</code>,
            including
            <code>uchar.h</code> instead of <code>wchar.h</code>.

            Also, I need to investigate some interactions between this patch and how
            it's displayed over ssh when you're connecting through Mac OS X.
