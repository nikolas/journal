        <p>
            I like to make changes that simplify our setup by removing
            the amount of different technologies we use, to reduce
            mental and maintenance overhead. We use public-facing
            nginx proxy servers that point to our internal application
            servers. On our PHP sites that use Drupal 7 or MediaWiki,
            these internal application servers were using Apache to
            serve the PHP code. It's been possible for a while now to
            use nginx in place of Apache for this, so I've recently
            made that change for our staging instances, and I'll be
            activating this for production soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            For MediaWiki, the application conf looks like this:
        </p>
<pre>
server {
    listen   80;
    server_name {{server_name}};
    root /var/www/{{app}};
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ @rewrite;
    }

    location @rewrite {
        rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?title=$1&$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
    }
}
</pre>
        <p>
            When making changes like this, it's often best to only
            change one thing at a time. But in this case I broke that
            rule by using this as an opportunity to test out using
            Ubuntu 16.04 / PHP 7, and things just worked without any
            issues.
