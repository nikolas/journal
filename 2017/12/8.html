            Ideally when making automated tests, you don't have to
            mock anything. You just test exactly what would be
            executed in production. Some scenarios make that a
            challenge, though.  What if you're testing a view that
            relies on an external authentication service, like an LTI
            server?
        </p>
        <p>
            It's probably possible to automate an LTI server to run
            alongside my tests, just like a test database. But that
            adds a lot of complexity without adding much
            value. Although that would make the test environment more
            similar to the production one, right now I just want to be
            able to detect regressions in my custom view.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm making a test for a view that uses
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/django-lti-provider/blob/master/lti_provider/mixins.py#L12">LTIAuthMixin</a>
            from
            the <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/django-lti-provider">django-lti-provider</a>
            library.  If you look at LTIAuthMixin, you can see that
            all the authentication is handled in
            <code>dispatch()</code>, a method that's called with each
            HTTP method of a view object
            (<code>.get()</code>, <code>.post()</code>, <code>.put()</code>,
            etc).
            Python has
            a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html">mock</a>
            library that I've never really gotten a handle on. I
            thought I could use this library here, and tried to mock
            out LTIAuthMixin's <code>dispatch()</code> method. I was
            able to get my test to ignore LTI authentication, but
            I couldn't figure out how to tell my
            mocked dispatch method to still return the necessary response
            data given a request with an authed user.
            So I kept thinking of alternatives, keeping in
            mind that all I cared about testing here is not even the view's <code>.get()</code>
            method, but just <code>.get_context_data()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through a combination of Django's
            <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/testing/advanced/#django.test.RequestFactory">RequestFactory</a>,
            and directly instantiating the view object, you can just
            alter its attributes as necessary. So I made a plan to not
            use Django's test client, and just do something like this:
        </p>
<pre>
# LoggedInTestMixin just sets self.u to an authenticated user.

class MyLTILandingPageTest(LoggedInTestMixin, TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        super(MyLTILandingPageTest, self).setUp()
        self.factory = RequestFactory()
        self.g = GraphFactory(title='Quiz graph',
                              needs_submit=True)
        self.submission = SubmissionFactory(
            graph=self.g, user=self.u, choice=3)

     def test_get(self):
        request = self.factory.get('/lti/landing/')
        request.user = self.u
        view = MyLTILandingPage()

        ctx = view.get_context_data()
        self.assertEqual(ctx.get('submissions').count(), 1)
</pre>
        <p>
            The above test runs into a few
            errors. <code>self.lti</code> needs to be set,
            and it also needs to respond to a <code>course_context()</code>
            method call. This turned out to be sufficient:
        </p>
<pre>
class MockLTI(object):
    def course_context(self, request):
        return None
</pre>
        <p>
            I also needed to attach the request object to the view
            I've instantiated, so it knows who the current user is.
            Here's the completed test:
        </p>
<pre>
def test_get(self):
    request = self.factory.get('/lti/landing/')
    request.user = self.u
    view = MyLTILandingPage()
    view.lti = MockLTI()
    view.request = request

    ctx = view.get_context_data()
    self.assertEqual(ctx.get('submissions').count(), 1)
    submission = ctx.get('submissions').first()
    self.assertEqual(submission.user, self.u)
    self.assertEqual(submission.choice, 3)
</pre>
        <p>
            Now my test confirms that this view's context data
            contains a graph submission connected to the authenticated
            user. It doesn't matter to <code>get_context_data()</code> that
            the user wasn't actually authenticated with LTI.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if there's a clearer, more idiomatic way to do this
            using Python's standard mock library, maybe a way to
            override dispatch() using mock, I'd love see some
            examples.
