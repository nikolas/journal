            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/django-lti-provider">django-lti-provider</a>
            is a Python library for integrating Django apps with an
            <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability">LTI</a>
            consumer
            like <a href="https://www.canvaslms.com/">Canvas</a>. django-lti-provider
            uses
            <a href="https://github.com/mitodl/pylti">pylti</a> to
            make LTI oauth requests. The
            <a href="https://github.com/pylti/lti">lti</a>
            library could also be used for this same purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            django-lti-provider
            has <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/django-lti-provider#documentation">documentation</a>
            on how to set everything up in Django, but I want to
            document a few challenges I ran into when trying to get
            grade submission to Canvas working.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to learn the Canvas interface and its concepts in
            order to figure out where you're going to integrate the
            tool. Integration can be done in Canvas's rich-text editor
            by defining a toolbar button, and then allowing an asset's
            iframe to be embedded in the Canvas content. This is a
            great method for its flexibility, but keep in mind that
            the LTI authentication step won't occur on the content you
            embed. The content author will be authenticated when they
            click the toolbar button, but the student viewing the
            content won't be. So, if you're expecting to
            do <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.assignment_tools.html">grade
            passback</a>, this method isn't a good option. For my
            purposes, I ended using an Canvas's Assignment model, and
            connecting my tool to it using the External Tool
            option. Now, when a student views the assignment, a POST
            request is made to my tool containing auth credentials for
            automatic authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also when you're developing, keep in mind that PyLTI
            doesn't yet give much detail about why a score submission
            request failed. So if you see django-lti-provider displaying
            a "Post grade failed" error, add the pylti logger to
            your <code>local_settings.py</code> and look at the actual
            response that Canvas gave:
        </p>
<pre>
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'pylti': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'level': os.getenv('DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL', 'DEBUG'),
        },
    },
}
</pre>
        <p>
            There are a few scenarios I've found that cause this to
            fail:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The score isn't a number between 0 and 1.</li>
            <li>
                The assignment doesn't have any number of points set.
            </li>
            <li>
                You're an instructor, not a student. For this, Canvas
                will say: <code>Invalid sourcedid</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                You removed your tool from Settings -> Apps ->
                External Apps and submitted a request to an Assignment
                you made before you removed the tool.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I expect that we'll improve the behavior
            of <code>django-lti-provider</code> and PyLTI to make them
            easier to use, and more aware of these scenarios.
