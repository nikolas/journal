            Django's
            <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/admin/">admin
            interface</a> provides an excellent and well-maintained UI
            for managing models in your Django database. They've
            included bulk editing functionality for operating on
            multiple models at once, like this:
        </p>
        <img src="img/screen1.png">
        <p>
            The checkboxes respond to the shift key, and are aware of
            the top checkbox, which can be used to toggle all
            selections on or off. We needed something like this in our
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/dmt">PMT</a> project
            for ticket re-assignment, mass milestone changes, etc.
            There was a lot of subtle UI functionality here that I
            wanted to use, and didn't want to re-write. Although I
            didn't find any documentation on how to integrate this
            into a custom application, I dug around the admin code and
            decided it wouldn't be so complicated to use Django's
            front-end code directly. The view I wanted to use this on
            as a first attempt is pretty simple: a MilestoneDetailView
            that displays a table of items, similar to Django's user
            editor shown above.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to use Django's JavaScript, the DOM elements needed
            to be very similar to how those in the Django admin view
            are laid out. So I copied the DOM, keeping a lot of attributes
            intact, and then adapted it to my needs. Here are the elements
            that are displayed above the table:
        </p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="actions form-inline"&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;
        Action: &lt;select name="action" required="" class="form-control input-sm"&gt;
            &lt;option value="" selected="selected"&gt;---------&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;option value="assign_selected"&gt;Re-assign selected&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;label class="assign-to hidden"&gt;
        Re-assign to: &lt;select name="assigned_to" class="form-control input-sm"&gt;
            &lt;option value="" selected="selected"&gt;---------&lt;/option&gt;
            {% for user in object.project.all_personnel_in_project %}
            &lt;option value="{{user.username}}"&gt;
                {% firstof user.fullname user.username %}
            &lt;/option&gt;
            {% endfor %}
        &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"
            title="Run the selected action"&gt;Go&lt;/button&gt;
    
    &lt;span class="action-counter help-block"
          data-actions-icnt="{{object.item_set.count}}"
          style="display: inline;"&gt;
        0 of {{object.item_set.count}} selected
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
            Additionally, the entire table now needs to be surrounded
            by a <code>&lt;form method="post"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code>
            element for the "Go" button to make a request to
            Django. And each table row now needs a checkbox column:
        </p>
<pre>
&lt;td class="action-checkbox"&gt;
    &lt;input class="action-select"
           name="_selected_action"
           type="checkbox"
           value="{{item.pk}}"&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
            To get the checkboxes working I dug around the Django
            admin page and searched through JavaScript code to find
            out how it was being controlled, and included the relevant
            code on our milestone page:
        </p>
<pre>
&lt;script src="/admin/jsi18n/">&lt;/script>
&lt;script>
    // A modified version of django's admin/js/jquery.init.js
    // This is necessary because Django's jquery initializer
    // called $.noConflict(), and we need the jQuery global
    // variable to be available for other JavaScript on the
    // page, like Bootstrap.
    var django = django || {};
    django.jQuery = jQuery;
&lt;/script>
&lt;script src="{% static 'admin/js/actions.js' %}">&lt;/script>
</pre>
        <p>
            Then I needed some custom code for our dropdown box: When
            're-assign to' is selected, I want to display the list of
            possible assignees, and when 'move' is selected, the list
            of possible milestones.
        </p>
<pre>
$('select[name="action"]').change(function(e) {
    var selected = $(this).find(':selected')[0].value;
    if (selected === 'assign') {
        $('.move-to-milestone').addClass('hidden');
        $('.assign-to').removeClass('hidden');
    } else if (selected === 'move') {
        $('.assign-to').addClass('hidden');
        $('.move-to-milestone').removeClass('hidden');
    } else {
        $('.assign-to,.move-to-milestone').addClass('hidden');
    }
});
</pre>
        <p>
            Now the front-end code is taken care of:
        </p>
        <img src="img/screen2.png">
        <p>
            The back-end was straightforward and could be handled
            easily. Out of curiousity, I looked into how Django had
            written their back-end for their editor, and found out
            that they've defined their delete action in
            <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/admin/actions.py">actions.py</a>.
            It looks like Django's bulk editor only supports deletion,
            and they display a delete confirmation page on form
            submit. I decided not to make a confirmation page, and
            handling item deletion isn't in our TODO list for the PMT,
            so it's not like we're doing operations on items that
            can't be undone.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did have to write the back-end code myself, but there's
            nothing really novel about it so I'll just link to our
            MilestoneDetailView
            here: <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/dmt/blob/master/dmt/main/views.py#L614">views.py#L614</a>.
            I imagine this could be refactored into a mixin to more
            easily integrate into other views, which I expect to do
            when we add this functionality to the PMT's homepage and
            project pages.
