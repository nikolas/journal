            We've been designing a new version of
            <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/worth3">Women on the Road to Health</a>
            with the goal of breaking it out of its web application
            mold to make it more easily distributable. We're thinking
            something with a little more interactive functionality
            than a PDF, so possibly
            an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">ePub</a>
            or an offline, standalone HTML5 application. The device
            we're primarily targeting is
            some type of Android tablet, but with the durability and
            sustainability that our chosen formats provide, we'd like
            to make it as widely compatible across different systems
            as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our intervention consists of a series of videos with some
            text and interactive activities interspersed throughout.
            Because it's so video-centric, we've been wondering
            whether an ePub makes sense for this experience. One
            advantage of using ePub is that the navigation controls
            are provided automatically by the ePub reader, which we'd
            otherwise need to design ourselves in an HTML5
            application.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're envisioning each interactive in this experience as
            sort of an independent world of its own, but still with a
            consistent look and feel. Here's an example of a simple
            system I've put together for handling that. My style of
            developing here is to sketch things out in a simple way
            and let it gradually evolve to the appropriate level
            of complexity or sophistication.
        </p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- In the ePub, each page is its own HTML file, 
     with a single activity's container.
     In the HTML5 app, the container is surrounded
     by a 'slide' element.
--&gt;
&lt;div class="container myth-fact"&gt;
    &lt;div class="panel s0"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Myth/Fact&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let's play the Myth/Fact Quiz game!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;button type="button" class="s1"&gt;
            Got it. Let's go!
        &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="panel hidden s1"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;True of False?&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The sky is always blue?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;button type="button" class="s2-true"&gt;True&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button type="button" class="s2-false"&gt;False&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    ...

&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
            Each activity has a progress bar that needs to be
            updated, so we can define this functionality
            for all activities in <code>common.js</code>:
        </p>
<pre>
// common.js

var updateProgressBar = function($container, percentage) {
    var $bar = $container.find('.progress-bar');
    $bar.css('width', percentage + '%');
    $bar.attr('aria-valuenow', percentage);
};
</pre>
        <p>
            Below is some of the code for the Myth/Fact activity.  The
            container is a key piece of data that I'm using to isolate
            these operations from everything else that could be going
            on in the page. Again, I might have to change this as we
            start putting multiple activities of the same type in the
            application, but this is good enough for our simple
            prototype.
        </p>
<pre>
// myth-fact.js

(function() {
    var resetActivity = function($container) {
        updateProgressBar($container, 0);
        $container.find('div.s0').removeClass('hidden');
        $container.find('button.s2-true,button.s2-false')
            .removeClass('disabled');
        $container.find('button.s2-true,button.s2-false')
            .removeAttr('disabled');
        $container.find('.alert.wrong-answer,.alert.right-answer')
            .addClass('hidden');
        $container.find('.alert.answer').addClass('hidden');
    };

    $(document).ready(function() {
        var $container = $('.container.myth-fact');

        $container.find('button.s1').click(function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            $(this).closest('div.panel').addClass('hidden');
            $container.find('div.s1').removeClass('hidden');
            updateProgressBar($container, 20);
        });

        ...
    });
})();
</pre>
        <p>
            The code illustrates the concept of each activity
            consisting of a series of panels, with only one panel
            visible at a given time. I'm doing this with JavaScript
            and jQuery, and it's stable enough. I'm betting that our
            activities are going to be simple enough that we can
            continue in this fashion, but I'm also keeping in mind
            that this is a job that would be handled really well by a
            UI tool like
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>.
            I don't think it's worth it at this point, since using
            React adds a noticable amount of overhead through maintenance 
            and deployment strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            And here's the code for another activity. I've started to
            work out the concept of each activity resetting itself
            in its own way:
        </p>
<pre>
// feeling.js

(function() {
    var resetActivity = function($container) {
        updateProgressBar($container, 0);
        $container.find('div.s0').removeClass('hidden');
    };

    $(document).ready(function() {
        var $container = $('.container.feeling');

        $container.find('figure').click(function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            $(this).closest('div.panel').addClass('hidden');
            $container.find('div.s1').removeClass('hidden');
            updateProgressBar($container, 100);
        });

        $container.find('button.s0').click(function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            $(this).closest('div.panel').addClass('hidden');
            resetActivity($container);
        });
    });
})();
