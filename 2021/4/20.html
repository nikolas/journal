                    I want to summarize part of the
                    <a href="https://ccnmtl.github.io/astro-simulations/gas-retention-simulator/">Gas Retention Simulator</a>
                    we've made as part of our effort to
                    re-work <a href="https://www.unl.edu/physics/kevin-lee">Kevin Lee</a>'s 
                    <a href="https://astro.unl.edu/">astronomy simulations</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This simulation includes a view of gas particles
                    flying around in a chamber. They bump into each
                    other, bump off the walls of the chamber, and
                    possibly escape the chamber, depending on the
                    settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've taken a course in computational physics
                    before, so I know how complicated making these
                    calculations yourself can be.
                    I knew I wanted to take advantage of some sort of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine">Physics engine</a>
                    to get all this working as best as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to use <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">Matter.js</a>
                    because many other people use this library, and it looks like it would
                    provide everything I need to put together this scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The typical Matter.js scene displays objects
                    pulled bottom of the screen with gravity. I needed
                    a different type of scene where gravity doesn't
                    come into play, but we still get physical movement
                    as the particles bounce around. You can turn
                    gravity off in the scene like this:
                </p>
<pre>
const engine = Engine.create();
engine.world.gravity.y = 0;
</pre>
                <p>
                    Now, we need to turn friction off when we create
                    the particles:
                </p>
<pre>
const particleOptions = {
    restitution: 1,
    friction: 0,
    frictionAir: 0
};
const particle = Matter.Bodies.circle(
    // initial particle position
    Math.random() * sceneWidth,
    Math.random() * sceneHeight,

    particleSize, 
    particleOptions
);
</pre>

                <p>
                    At this stage in the process, we have a bunch of
                    particles at random positions. Because we turned
                    off gravity, they're not going anywhere.
                </p>

                <img src="particles.png" 
                     alt="Screenshot of particles at random positions on the screen" />

                <p>
                    To make them move, we give them each a random direction,
                    and set their velocity based on that direction.
                </p>

<pre>
const direction = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
Matter.Body.setVelocity(p, {
    x: Math.sin(direction) * PARTICLE_SPEED,
    y: Math.cos(direction) * PARTICLE_SPEED
});
</pre>

                <p>
                    Now you should have them moving around like this:
                </p>
