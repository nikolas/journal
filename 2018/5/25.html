        <p>
             I've turned over a new leaf in how I approach
             security. I've <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~njn2118/journal/2018/1/11.html">mentioned</a> in the past that I haven't
             always understood, or given too much respect to the
             security community. When vulnerabilities like <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a>
             come and go, my rationale is, sure - obviously OpenSSL
             should be patched. But what about all the other
             vulnerabilities that we haven't found yet? It just seemed
             like a lost cause.
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer, and I'm probably late to the game for this but
            hey - we all come to conclusions on our own time - is
            "layered security". By combining multiple security efforts
            all at once, individual security vulnerabilities become
            less important, and more manageable.
            It becomes kind of a game: What kind of network traffic do
            you expect?  What kind of traffic can you automatically
            reject, and at how many different points in your stack can
            you reject it?
        </p>
        <p>
            A firewall is more specifically a tool for filtering
            network packets. It's best to configure it to just reject
            anything you don't want before it reaches your
            applications, even if you're not running any questionable
            services. On Linux systems, the standard is pretty much
            <a href="https://netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html">iptables</a>, so I've learned how to set up and use that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that <a href="https://netfilter.org/projects/nftables/index.html">nftables</a> has been developed as a successor to
            iptables, but iptables is still way more widely-used than
            nftables, so a working knowledge of iptables remains
            valuable. In other words:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OH: &quot;In any team you need a tank, a healer, a damage dealer, someone with crowd control abilities, and another who knows iptables&quot;</p>&mdash; Jérôme Petazzoni (@jpetazzo) <a href="https://twitter.com/jpetazzo/status/614851069508595712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

        <p>
            Besides,
            it seems that <a href="https://cilium.io/blog/2018/04/17/why-is-the-kernel-community-replacing-iptables/">bpfilter</a> is the current craze in this world
            over nftables. Ubuntu provides <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall">UFW</a>, a front-end to
            nftables/iptables, (Ubuntu's answer to Red Hat's
            <a href="http://www.firewalld.org/">firewalld</a>). ufw aims to be more intuitive to use than
            iptables/nftables. My process has always been to start with the
            basics, and then move on to the fancier things after
            revisiting everything, so I chose to start with iptables.
        </p>
        <p>
            How do you look at iptables rules?
            <dl>
                <dt><code>iptables -L -v</code></dt>
                <dd>verbose listing</dd>

                <dt><code>iptables -L</code></dt>
                <dd>less verbose</dd>

                <dt><code>iptables -S</code></dt>
                <dd>compact</dd>
            </dl>
        </p>
        <p>
            You might see a rule like this:
        </p>
        <pre>-A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/16 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT</pre>
        <p>
            This tells the system to accept packets coming in on port
            22 within the 192.168.*.* range of IPs. Note the IP
            address: iptables uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR</a> notation for IP
            addresses. This is a little less intuitive than something
            like 127.127.*.*. Read 127.127.0.0/16 like "the first 16
            bits of this address are significant, and the rest are
            wildcards". So if you wanted to accept only the exact IP
            127.127.42.12, that would be 127.127.42.12/32. Or
            192.168.0.* would be 192.168.0.0/24.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three areas to hook into the iptables procedure:
            INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT. These are referred to as
            "chains". Here's a nice ascii diagram showing the idea of
            how they relate:
        </p>
        <pre>
                          _____
Incoming                 /     \         Outgoing
       -->[Routing ]--->|FORWARD|------->
          [Decision]     \_____/        ^
               |                        |
               v                       ____
              ___                     /    \
             /   \                  |OUTPUT|
            |INPUT|                  \____/
             \___/                      ^
               |                        |
                ----> Local Process ----
            </pre>
            <div>
            &mdash; <a href="https://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO-6.html">https://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO-6.html</a>
        </div>
                    <p>
                        So, the INPUT chain deals with packets getting
                        sent to a local process, like sshd or
                        nginx. That's what's most interesting right
                        now - let's start blocking access! Each table
                        has a policy: either ACCEPT or DROP. By
                        default, everything is ACCEPT. It's
                        <a href="https://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO-11.html">recommended</a> to actually set things up so all
                        policies are DROP, then open up only what's
                        necessary. That's kind of extreme, but maybe
                        I will start doing it that way in the future.
                        As a first step, and to get things basically working,
                        use a DROP policy for the INPUT table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make these rules persistent, you save all
                        your iptables rules to a file, and then when
                        the network starts up, read that file with
                        iptables-restore. Something like this:
                    </p>
