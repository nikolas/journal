            The <a href="https://www.brave.com/">Brave</a>
            project is making a web browser that contains many features
            that have only been available as browser extensions until
            now. These include an ad blocker, tracking script blocker,
            and "<a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS
            Everywhere</a>" capability. Browsers like this have come
            and gone (<a href="https://www.palemoon.org/">Pale
            Moon</a>, many obscure WebKit front-ends
            like <a href="https://surf.suckless.org/">surf</a>), but
            Brave may be able to gain enough traction to be
            influential. We'll see. The project was co-founded by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brandon Eich</a> in 2016.

            I'm not necessarily paranoid about my unencrypted data
            on the web, or being tracked - I
            don't use a VPN service but I've been thinking about
            getting one. But for anyone browsing the web, I can't
            imagine a situation where you would want to look at an ad,
            communicate with a tracking script, or opt to use HTTP
            instead of HTTPS. Brave has the right idea because these
            features should just be built-in to the browser.

            Do ads serve a purpose, though? Maybe, I
            don't know. <a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html">readthedocs</a>
            is using advertising as a sustainable business model - is
            there anything wrong with that? Recently, I've become one
            of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw">PewDiePie</a>'s
            62 million YouTube subscribers. Advertising on YouTube has
            made him millions of dollars every year.

            of bullshit. One tip of the iceberg? Charging sellers for
            their position in its marketplace. This company, to me,
            crosses off many items in the list of failures of
            capitalism.  But yeah, Deanna Havas points out:

            Google Chrome has been described as a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">botnet</a>" (I've heard
            that <a href="https://iridiumbrowser.de/">Iridium</a> is
            better). Firefox's not-quite-mainstream status means that
            it often gives in to the status quo through fear of losing
            relevance, like including
            annoying <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-drm">DRM</a>
            software. I don't know if Brave includes DRM software, but
            I can already see that removing stakeholders from the
            equation means that Brave can do things its own way. To
            the Brave project, that means taking away a lot of the
            features/bugs that Internet users have come to perceive as
            "normal". New projects like this have the freedom to set
            the standard.

            Brave uses Chromium's Blink engine for displaying web
            pages, and puts its own user interface on top of that.
            I've been using Brave as my main browser for a week now
            and it doesn't have any major quirks, and it's noticeably
            faster than Firefox. Because it uses a lot of Chromium's
            UI components, I can imagine doing web development
            with Brave, but I think I will still be using Chromium as
            well for a while.
