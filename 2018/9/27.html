                <p>
                    Over the past few months that I've been working
                    with graphical programming, it's been fun to get
                    insight into how the real world works, i.e., how
                    things are visually laid out and move around.
                    Sometimes it reminds me of a book I liked reading
                    when I was younger,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_Things_Work">The
                    Way Things Work</a>.  The book is all
                    illustrations, so you don't actually read it so
                    much as pore over the details in all its drawings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This post goes over how to program an analog-style
                    clock like this one, with draggable minute and
                    hour hands.
                </p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img style="margin: 0 auto;" src="img/clock.gif" alt="an animated clock" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    The clock I'm making is actually a 24-hour clock,
                    not a 12-hour clock, but all the movement is the
                    same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all, separate out what moves in this
                    scene from what always stays the same. There are
                    really three different things to think about here:
                    the clock face, the minute hand, and the hour
                    hand.
                    If you don't already have some image to use as the
                    clock face, search for one online or make one in
                    <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a>
                    (There's really no reason to use Adobe's stuff).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the clock face I'm using:
                </p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img style="margin: 0 auto;" src="img/clockface.png" alt="a clock face" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Also, I'm using <a href="http://www.pixijs.com/">Pixi</a> instead
                    of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a>
                    for two reasons: I need to treat the clock hands
                    like objects (rotating them independently of each
                    other), and also I want to respond to mouse
                    movements and dragging behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the code, the first thing to do is make the
                    clock's DOM container element and put the clock
                    face in it.  Once the DOM is ready to be
                    interacted with (i.e., in
                    the <code>componentDidMount()</code> callback if
                    you're using React), create the PIXI.Application,
                    load the clock face image, and start the initial
                    drawing procedure.
                </p>
<pre>
componentDidMount() {
    const me = this;

    const timePickerApp = new PIXI.Application({
        backgroundColor: 0xffffff,
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        sharedLoader: true,
        sharedTicker: true,
        forceCanvas: true
    });
    this.timePickerApp = timePickerApp;
    this.timePicker.appendChild(timePickerApp.view);

    this.loader.load((loader, resources) => {
        me.resources = resources;

        me.drawClockScene(timePickerApp, resources.clock);
    });
}
</pre>
                <p>
                    Now let's make the hands of the clock. Here are some
                    relevant parts of a function called
                    from <code>componentDidMount()</code>.
                    Don't be intimidated by all the rigmarole
                    here... I know it looks awkward but it all comes
                    from trial and error, building things up from the
                    basics. For example, through putting this together
                    I found that I need to use a PIXI.Container, even
                    though it only contains one object, just because of
                    a quirk with Pixi that makes Containers easier to
                    rotate.
                </p>
                <pre>
drawClockScene(app, resource) {
    const center = new PIXI.Point(
        app.view.width / 2, app.view.height / 2);

    // Draw the minute hand
    // Put it in a PIXI.Container so it's easier to rotate.
    const minuteContainer = new PIXI.Container();
    minuteContainer.interactive = true;
    minuteContainer.buttonMode = true;
    const minuteHand = new PIXI.Graphics()
                             .beginFill(0x666666)
                             .drawRoundedRect(
                                 0, 0,
                                 4, bg.height / 2.3,
                                 4);
    minuteContainer.addChild(minuteHand);
    minuteContainer.position.set(this.center.x, this.center.y);
    minuteContainer.pivot = new PIXI.Point(2, 5);
    minuteContainer.rotation = Math.PI;
    app.stage.addChild(minuteContainer);
    this.minuteHand = minuteContainer;
}
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The code for drawing the hour hand is pretty
                    much the same, so I'm not going to include it
                    here. There's a link to the full source code at
                    the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you start programming any sort of circular
                    motion like this, you quickly learn the significance
                    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi</a>,
                    and how to work with it along with the related
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine">Sine</a>
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine">Cosine</a>
                    functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can represent angles in degrees or radians.
                    Sometimes it's actually more convenient to work
                    with radians instead of degrees, it doesn't really
                    matter - I switch between these unit types all the
                    time in the code. Just remember that:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A full circle == Pi * 2 radians == 360 degrees
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how would you display the minute hand at the
                    correct rotation? There are 60 minutes in an hour,
                    which the minute hand displays as a full
                    circle. So you can treat each minute as one
                    sixtieth of Pi * 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here in React code, when the time state
                    changes, the minute and hour hands are updated to
                    reflect that state. <code>getMinutes()</code> returns the
                    current time's minute (0 to 59), and the angle of
                    a single minute can be written as one sixtieth of Pi
                    * 2. There's also an offset of -Pi at the end of
                    the equation, just because of a particularity in
                    where the minute hand's initial position is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hour hand moves in a similar way. You can
                    replace the 24 below with 12 for a 12-hour clock.
                </p>
<pre>
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if (prevProps.dateTime !== this.props.dateTime) {
        // Update the clock.
        const minutes = this.props.dateTime.getMinutes();
        this.minuteHand.rotation = (minutes / 60) * (Math.PI * 2)
                                 - Math.PI;

        const hours = this.props.dateTime.getHours();
        this.hourHand.rotation = ((hours + (minutes / 60)) / 24) * (
            Math.PI * 2) - Math.PI;
    }
}
</pre>
                <p>
                    Making these clock hands draggable by the user is
                    a whole new challenge. I'll go over that in a
                    separate post because there's a lot more to it,
                    and required a lot more learning on my part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the mean time, you can see the final result of
                    this clock in
                    the <a href="https://ccnmtl.github.io/astro-interactives/sun-motion-simulator/">Motions
                    of the Sun Simulator</a>, and the source code is
                    here:
                    <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/astro-interactives/blob/master/sun-motion-simulator/src/Clock.jsx">Clock.jsx</a>.
                    Again, there's a lot of idiosyncratic code
                    involved to make all the fine-tunings correct. But
                    I hope this is helpful for anyone else making a
                    graphical analog clock, or just as a re-usable
                    React component.

                <h3>Note about tool and language choice</h3>
                <p>
                    I see developers put a lot of importance into the
                    languages, tools, and frameworks they use. I've
                    been working on another post just focusing on that
                    topic, but in general I think that all this
                    discussion and attention to detail is better spent
                    on what you're actually making.  Five years ago, I
                    probably would've chosen to make this clock in
                    <a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/#overview">Ext.JS</a>
                    and
                    <a href="http://www.pixijs.com/">Pixi</a> instead
                    of <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and
                    Pixi, because React wasn't around then.  The "best
                    tools for the job" mentality doesn't apply as much
                    as developers want it to: You can always use a
                    different code editor, IDE, a different framework,
                    etc. and get the same results. It's just a matter
                    of translation between different environments -
                    computers all behave the same way, with the same
                    basic operations, regardless of the syntactic sugar
                    the developer chooses to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How should you choose what language to use? It
                    only depends on how you want users to access and
                    use the program. If you're making something
                    interactive on the web, there's no reason not to
                    use JavaScript. An iOS or Android app? Use
                    Objective-C or whatever Android uses (Java?). etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This rule of thumb works in my experience, which
                    is limited to small, self-contained applications.
                    If you're working on something with hundreds of
                    developers on it, maybe there's something to say
                    for using TypeScript, the fancier features of ES6,
                    making your own virtual machine
                    like <a href="https://hhvm.com/">HHVM</a>, who
                    knows. I can't really say. Basically, I love
                    functional programming as much as anyone who's
                    used Haskell, but for putting together a small, 
                   interactive UI application, there's no problem
                    with using the standard languages that work in the
                    same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative paradigm</a>
                    as the hardware beneath all the abstractions.
