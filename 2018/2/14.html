            Recently, I've been getting more and more
            into <a href="https://jsxgraph.org/">JSXGraph</a>. It's
            an interactive geometry and plotting library that's been
            around for at least 10 years, while still maintaining a
            good amount activity and relevance. Which is impressive in
            the JavaScript world.  It's developed at the University of
            Bayreuth by Alfred Wassermann.
        </p>
        <p>
            When
            developing <a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/econplayground.js">econplayground</a>,
            some of the functionality requires two functions on a
            graph: one linear, one non-linear.  For the linear
            function, I can get away with just using a
            JSXGraph <a href="https://jsxgraph.org/docs/symbols/Line.html">Line</a>,
            and for the non-linear curve,
            a <a href="https://jsxgraph.org/docs/symbols/Functiongraph.html">Functiongraph</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            JSXGraph also supports displaying the
            <a href="https://jsxgraph.org/docs/symbols/Intersection.html">Intersection</a>
            of two lines, calculated dynamically as those lines are
            moved. You can see how I'm setting all this up <a href="js/custom.js">here</a>.
        </p
>
        <p>
            Line A is a JSXGraph Line and Line B is a Functiongraph:
        </p>
        <div class="graph" id="box1"></div>
        <p>
            In this example, the intersection point disappears
            when dragging the orange line, or when dragging the blue
            line to the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            One workaround is to use a Functiongraph for both lines, suggested by a user on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48773386/jsxgraph-intersection-between-functiongraph-and-line-disappears#comment84548863_48773386">StackOverflow</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, both lines are Functiongraphs:
        </p>
        <div class="graph" id="box3"></div>
    </div>
