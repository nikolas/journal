                    You can now do even more in JavaScript than you
                    ever could in Flash.
                    Google and the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8">V8
                    team</a> made new technology that pressured
                    all mainstream browsers to make JavaScript as
                    efficient as it can be. The performance
                    improvements, which are something like 100 times
                    the speed of old JavaScript engines from pre-2008, have
                    allowed for the development of new rendering
                    standards
                    like <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/">Canvas</a>.
                    It's now even typical for say, graphics
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demos</a>
                    on <a href="http://www.pouet.net/">Pouet</a> to be
                    made in three.js alongside all the contributions
                    for c64 and Amiga that have been made for years.
                    These events all helped prompt my own decision to
                    just focus on web development rather than get
                    further into iOS development, when I was trying
                    that out in 2012.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, this technology is just waiting to be used,
                    but how do you actually put things together in a
                    simple, organized way?  Starting from scratch
                    (because when I start anywhere else I don't
                    learn as much), you can set up a run loop to
                    animate programs
                    using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval">setInterval()</a>:
                </p>
<pre>
setInterval(function() {
    moveSomethingOnTheScreen();
}, 200);
</pre>
                <p>
                    Maybe you want your moveSomething method to be a
                    function of some "time" value that's incremented
                    regularly. That way, you can control the speed of
                    the motion, and everything you want to animate
                    will use this single time value to determine
                    where they should appear:
                </p>
<pre>
var time = 0;

setInterval(function() {
    moveSomethingOnTheScreen(time);

    time += 0.01;
}, 200);
</pre>
                <p>
                    The 200 I'm passing in to setInterval means "run
                    this every 200 milliseconds". It's kind of
                    arbitrary... you can increase or decrease it to
                    whatever you want and see what happens. You can
                    also let the browser decide what this value should be
                    with
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">requestAnimationFrame()</a>.
                </p>
<pre>
var time = 0;

function moveSomethingOnTheScreen() {
    // move a DOM element or something

    time += 0.01;

    requestAnimationFrame(moveSomethingOnTheScreen);
};

requestAnimationFrame(moveSomethingOnTheScreen);
</pre>
                <p>
                    If you want to stop the animation, setInterval and
                    requestAnimationFrame both return an ID that you
                    can call clearInterval() or cancelAnimationFrame()
                    on. Even when you're using comprehensive drawing
                    frameworks
                    like <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>
                    or <a href="http://www.pixijs.com/">pixi.js</a>,
                    handling the animation step with
                    requestAnimationFrame() is still the norm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all you need for animation - but what
                    do you want to animate? You can hook this run loop
                    up to any visualization that JavaScript can reach:
                    graphs, math visualizations, 3D scenes, etc.
                    Libraries like these don't render HTML dom elements -
                    that's too limiting for graphics. Most of them
                    render with Canvas or SVG.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element is fun to mess
                    around with, and there's a lot you can do with
                    just that. In fact, WebGL all happens through the
                    Canvas element, so whatever you want to do, you
                    should learn the basics of Canvas.
                    Mozilla's 
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial">Canvas tutorial</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">API docs</a> are helpful.
                    When using Canvas, keep in mind that the browser
                    only thinks of it as some arbitrary bitmap - a
                    series of colored pixels: any shapes you draw sort
                    of slip out of your fingers and into the bitmap.
                    You can't do
                    <code>var circle = canvasContext.arc();</code> and
                    then move that circle around
                    because <code>arc()</code>, along with all the
                    drawing methods, are void type and don't return
                    anything. This constraint is fun to work around
                    because anything is still possible with
                    Canvas. But if you need to treat parts of your
                    graphics as objects because they're interactive,
                    like responding to mouse movement, that's where it
                    quickly gets too complicated because there's too
                    much to keep track of, including UX subtleties
                    that you shouldn't be expected to handle. In that
                    case, I recommend using a Canvas-based framework
                    like Pixi.js.

                    I've been working on porting these
                    <a href="http://astro.unl.edu/animationsLinks.html">astronomy visualizations</a>
                    originally developed at the University of Nebraska
                    from Flash to JavaScript
                    (<a href="https://github.com/ccnmtl/astro-interactives">astro-interactives</a>). All
                    this new web technology is well-suited for these
                    kinds of things. I'm using React because from what
                    I've seen, the code just becomes simpler and more
                    reliable when you're not manually manipulating DOM
                    elements. React is a large library though - you
                    can get a similar development experience by
                    combining <a href="https://github.com/adamhaile/S">S.js</a>
                    with JSX.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So to show how you can actually use the animation
                    example above, here's the animate function that
                    runs in a loop to animate a three.js scene.  

                    You can see how the sky color is dynamic:
                    getSkyColor() returns a blue color when the sun is
                    above the horizon, and black when it's beneath it.
                </p>
<pre>
animate() {
    this.sun.position.x = 50 * Math.cos(this.props.observerAngle);
    this.sun.position.z = 50 * Math.sin(this.props.observerAngle);
    this.sun.rotation.y = -this.props.observerAngle +
                          THREE.Math.degToRad(90);

    this.skyMaterial.color.setHex(this.getSkyColor(this.props.observerAngle));

    this.moon.position.x = 50 * Math.cos(this.props.moonObserverPos);
    this.moon.position.z = 50 * Math.sin(this.props.moonObserverPos);
    this.moon.rotation.y = -this.props.moonObserverPos + THREE.Math.degToRad(90);

    this.renderScene();
    this.frameId = window.requestAnimationFrame(this.animate);
}
</pre>
<small>From <code>lunar-phase-simulator/HorizonView.jsx</code></small>
                <p>
                    The sun and moon move in a circular orbit created
                    by passing in radian values to sine and cosine
                    functions.  I don't know the math offhand - I just
                    work through trial and error. The observerAngle
                    and moonObserverPos values are being passed in
                    from the main React component in main.jsx, and
                    are controlled and incremented from there, in
                    their own animate loop:
                </p>
<pre>
animate() {
    const me = this;
    this.setState(prevState => ({
        observerAngle: me.incrementAngle(prevState.observerAngle),
        moonPhase: me.incrementMoonPhaseAngle(prevState.moonPhase),
        moonObserverPos: me.getMoonObserverPos(
            prevState.observerAngle, prevState.moonPhase)
    }));
    this.frameId = requestAnimationFrame(this.animate);
}
</pre>
<small>From <code>lunar-phase-simulator/main.jsx</code></small>
                <p>
                    So, through methodical organization and trial and
                    error, you can build these pieces up to make any
                    sort of visualization as a function of a few
                    pieces of core data, tied together in sync. Here's
                    an iframe of the Lunar Phase Simulator that's
                    still in progress. The animation basics are in
                    place - at the moment I need to fix some problems
                    with the mouse interactions.
