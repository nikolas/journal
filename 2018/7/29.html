                    If you're using Linux, using your own Linux kernel
                    has benefits that might be helpful to
                    you. And once things are set up on your system,
                    keeping up to date is as straightforward as doing
                    a periodic <code>sudo apt upgrade</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're using a newer laptop, updating your
                    kernel can solve lots of issues because the
                    hardware is still new, and kernel developers
                    are still figuring out how to work with the new
                    hardware. If your touchpad or wireless card is
                    acting weird on a newer laptop, sometimes just
                    trying the newest kernel solves the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most distributions have their own version of the
                    kernel maintained by the distribution. Ubuntu and Red
                    Hat fork a major kernel version like 4.9, and
                    stick with that for some version of their
                    distribution, applying security updates while that
                    distribution release is supported. That doesn't
                    mean you can't use a newer kernel with that
                    distribution. Kernel updates have all sorts of
                    driver updates and internal changes, but they're
                    careful not to break existing functionality with
                    userspace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cloning the kernel repository downloads a few
                    gigabytes of data. If you're just planning on
                    making the kernel as a one-time thing, or for any
                    reason don't need the whole git repo, just download
                    one of the kernel tarballs from kernel.org, and
                    follow the process below without the git commands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://git.kernel.org/">git.kernel.org</a>
                    has a bunch of different forks of the kernel.
                    You probably just want the main "stable" one 
                    <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/">here</a>.
                </p>
<pre>
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git linux-stable
cd linux-stable
</pre>
                <p>
                    That repository follows the latest "mainline"
                    version
                    on <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>.
                    You can also follow an even more well-tested version than that
                    by following one of the branches, like <code>linux-4.17.y</code>:
                </p>
<pre>
git checkout linux-4.17.y
</pre>
                <p>
                    So now that you have the repository cloned, here's
                    how you can set up the kernel configuration. This is an
                    essential step that makes it work on your system.
                    The easiest way to do this is just base your
                    configuration off of the one that's already
                    working on the kernel you're running. Some
                    distributions rely on different kernel options
                    than others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Find your running kernel configuration. Some distributions
                    put this in <code>/boot</code>, and some kernels have this
                    available in their <code>/proc</code> filesystem at
                    <code>/proc/config.gz</code>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does <code>ls /boot/config*</code> return anything?</li>
                        <li><code>ls /proc/config*</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    Sometimes the kernel's config can be
                    extracted from the kernel file
                    with <code>scripts/extract-ikconfig</code>. I've
                    never used this but you can find info about it
                    somewhere.
                    Once you've found your configuration, copy the
                    config to your repository's kernel config:
                </p>
<pre>
cp /boot/config-4.16.0-2-amd64 .config
</pre>
                <p>
                    Take a look at this file if you want
                    with <code>less</code> &mdash; it's just a bunch of
                    CONFIG settings mostly set to "y", "m", or "n".
                    No one edits this manually &mdash; you would use some
                    tool like <code>make nconfig</code> to make
                    changes to this, but you don't need to do that
                    yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kernel config options are added and removed with
                    each kernel release, so these options won't match up 
                    exactly, but they're fine to start with and there's
                    the <code>make oldconfig</code> target that's used
                    to smooth out the differences and make any relatively
                    recent config compatible with the current one.
                </p>
<pre>
make oldconfig
</pre>
                <p>
                    If there are new config options available, make
                    oldconfig will ask you what you want to do. You
                    can probably always just choose the default
                    answer, by pressing Enter at each prompt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point you can make the kernel and install
                    it.
                </p>
<pre>
make -j2
</pre>
                <p>
                    If you have an 8-core processor or something 
                    (check that with <code>less /proc/cpuinfo</code>)
                    you can change this to <code>make -j8</code>,
                    or <code>make -j6</code> if you don't want the
                    compile operation to slow down whatever you're
                    doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once that's done, you can install the kernel:
                </p>
<pre>
sudo make modules_install install
</pre>
                <p>
                    <code>make modules_install</code> makes a
                    directory for this kernel version
                    in <code>/lib/modules</code> and copies the module
                    files there. <code>make install</code> copies the
                    main kernel file &mdash; vmlinuz &mdash;
                    to <code>/boot</code>, and maybe some others as
                    well. It also updates your grub configuration
                    to point to this new kernel. This part of the
                    guide is probably biased towards Debian/Ubuntu.
                    I'm not sure how different things work here on
                    other distributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you can reboot, and see how things are working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're curious, you can look at all the config
                    options in the kernel with <code>make nconfig</code>.
                    This is an ncurses interface that updates
                    the <code>.config</code> file on the Save (F6) command.
                    You exit with F9 or ctrl-C, navigate around the options
                    with the arrow keys, and you can search config
                    strings with F8. Press <code>y</code>, <code>m</code>,
                    or <code>n</code> on an option to enable it, compile
                    it as a module, or disable it.
                    Pressing <code>?</code> on a config option shows
                    its help. Some of these docs are more helpful
                    than others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're on a laptop, one good option to change
                    is CPU Frequency Scaling. Go into Power
                    Management, then CPU Frequency Scaling, then
                    update Default CPUFreq Governor to conservative.
                    That makes the laptop's battery last longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The kernel's Makefile contains more commands
                    you might be interested in. Run <code>make help</code> to
                    see them all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To stay up to date, go into
                    your <code>linux-stable</code> directory and run a
                    few commands:
                </p>
<pre>
git pull
make oldconfig
make -j2
sudo make modules_install install
</pre>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/">KernelNewbies</a>
                    is a good site with some general info about all
                    this. 
                    They have a similar guide you can use as a
                    supplement to this one at
                    their <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelBuild">KernelBuild</a>
                    page.
                    Their <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges">LinuxChanges</a>
                    page summarizes the kernel changelog into
                    something nice and readable, but it's not always
                    up to date with the latest release.
