                    Developers put a lot of thought into the
                    languages, tools, and frameworks they use. All
                    this discussion and attention to detail is better
                    spent on what you're actually making. The "best
                    tools for the job" mentality doesn't apply as much
                    as developers want it to: You can always use a
                    different code editor, IDE, a different framework,
                    etc. and get the same results. It's just a matter
                    of translation between different environments -
                    computers all behave the same way, with the same
                    basic operations, regardless of what syntactic
                    sugar the developer chooses to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How should you decide what language to use? It
                    only depends on how you want users to access and
                    use the program. If you're making something
                    interactive on the web, there's no reason not to
                    use JavaScript. An iOS or Android app? Use
                    Objective-C or whatever Android uses (Java?), etc.
                    For server-side web programming, I haven't seen
                    major differences between Python, Ruby, or
                    PHP. You can add more recent developments like
                    Go or Rust to this list, as they're imperative as
                    well. Sure, how things are put together,
                    deployment, libraries, are all pretty different
                    across these communities, and the choice can come
                    down to any of these factors. But in general you
                    can make a given piece of functionality in any
                    environment you want to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sure, I'm completely ignoring a bunch of factors
                    like scaling, performance, etc. But in all the
                    situations I've been in as a web developer, (i.e.,
                    not working at a big company like Facebook or
                    Google), those factors should be ignored, because
                    they don't matter in the cases I've seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This rule of thumb works in my experience, which
                    is limited to small, self-contained applications.
                    If you're working on something with hundreds of
                    developers on it, maybe there's something to say
                    for using TypeScript, the fancier features of ES6,
                    making your own virtual machine
                    like <a href="https://hhvm.com/">HHVM</a>, who
                    knows. I can't really say. Basically, I love
                    functional programming as much as anyone who's
                    used Haskell, but for putting together a small, 
                    interactive UI application, there's no problem
                    with using the standard languages that work in the
                    same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative paradigm</a>
                    as the hardware beneath all the abstractions.

                    That said, personally I've loved diving down
                    rabbit holes related to programming languages,
                    maybe not for the same reasons. For example,
                    things like
                    <a href="http://anynowhere.com/bb/layout/html/doors/local/frameset_linoleum.html">L.in.oleum</a>,
                    developed by some obscure developer with an
                    ambitious idea completely disconnected from the
                    mainstream, these are essential parts of what
                    makes the web interesting.
