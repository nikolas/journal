            The beginning of a new year always feels kind of
            weird. Maybe it's that I wasn't done with the last year,
            but something usually feels off to me, like it shouldn't
            be 2018 yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been messing around and reading about
            <a href="http://www.minix3.org/">Minix</a>, trying to
            understand how filesystems work. Don't ask me why. I was
            thinking I could do something achievable but useful like
            try adding FAT or ext3/4 support to Minix. Well, at the
            moment, I'd be really proud of even getting Minix's ext2
            driver to work correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, obviously, you can't just jump in to the Minix source
            code and automatically know your way around, or how to
            begin going about adding a filesystem.  But like I've
            learned through anything I've ever done, just spend enough
            time with something and it can become natural, even if it
            makes no sense at first.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reading through the Minix documentation and source code
            alongside
            <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Tanenbaum-Operating-Systems-Design-and-Implementation-3rd-Edition/PGM228096.html">Operating
            Systems: Design and Implementation</a> is a really cool
            experience anyways. Minix is an operating system designed
            from the start to be used for teaching. It's dedicated to
            a simple-as-possible approach, and is filled with
            clear, straightforward documentation.
            Through extensive comments and READMEs, the authors fully
            describe each piece of code and decision they've made. And
            there's so much to be learned when you can see, for example,
            the code for <code>mount</code>, with its giant conditional
            allowing for more than one partition to be mounted at root (<code>/</code>). I 
            didn't know that was possible! Not that I'll ever use that.
        </p>
        <p>
            So yeah, I find operating systems interesting because you can
            feel the human element of the authors coming out of the
            code. And it's just amazing that it all actually
            works. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, Minix's file layout has been re-organized, and
            many utilities have been brought over from
            <a href="http://netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> including its
            package manager. So, Minix is no longer just for
            experiments and education, but also a system where you can
            use many tools already available for standard Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking of Linux, I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate">don't care</a>
            right now that Minix is a "micro-kernel" and Linux is
            "monolithic". Minix is designed in a way that allows its drivers, 
            like the filesystem, to be run as processes in userspace, instead
            of in kernel space. If that doesn't mean much to you, well it
            doesn't mean much to me either. The only consequence of this
            that I've noticed is that even low-level filesystem code is 
            able to include standard C headers like <code>string.h</code>
            and <code>unistd.h</code>, instead of using their own lower-level
            versions of these libraries. I'm just using Minix to learn
            about operating systems, and for anyone that wants to do that,
            I recommend it.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the new year came, I kept seeing new articles about
            some kind of bug in Intel CPUs. I'm not a security person
            &mdash; I don't take it too seriously because I think computers
            in general are taken way too seriously. If you're worried
            about someone finding something out about you, don't enter
            that info in a computer &mdash; just like how you wouldn't write
            it in a notebook, I dunno. But yeah, we don't have a
            choice these days, with doctor's records, banks, education,
            everything completely in the digital realm. So digital
            security becomes important, and we're making it up as we
            go along, as an afterthought to the actual functionality
            that we get out of computers.
            As a web developer and
            all-around Linux geek, I had watched random vulnerabilities
            come up like the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a>
            bug in 2014, with mild interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            This new vulnerability was interesting because the fixes
            (which are only able to mitigate parts of the problem)
            required big changes in most operating systems that run on an
            Intel CPU, and all the drama that unfolded.
            The OpenBSD
            developers, security experts, found bitter satisfaction in
            the failure of this particular security-through-obscurity
            style NDA used with the major operating systems
            developers, in a message titled
            <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=151522749523849">'Meltdown,
            aka "Dear Intel, you suck"'</a>. According to the OpenBSD
            developers, Intel sucks not because of their small flaw in
            CPU design, rather what they did to fix it. They
            approached a few major OS developers, excluding OpenBSD
            and many others, about this flaw that requires changes to
            the operating system. Under an NDA, everyone agreed to
            make this public somewhere around January 9, 2018, once
            all the fixes were in place.
            Before that date,
            some savvy journalists started <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/">reporting</a>
            on telling commits in the Linux kernel, and with a snowball effect,
            security nerds <a href="https://twitter.com/brainsmoke/status/948561799875502080">everywhere</a>
            deduced the full situation: that there's a weird hardware
            bug in Intel's CPUs.
            This led to widespread knowledge of this vulnerability
            a week before, for example, Ubuntu's patches were all ready.
            Did that cause more damage than if Intel had just told
            the whole world publicly, at once? Who knows.
            The OpenBSD developer asks sarcastically, "Aren't we all
            glad that this was under embargo and strongly believe in
            the future value of embargoes?"
            And any die-hard proprietary software fanatic (do those
            exist?) could just use this as another of their few
            reasons not to develop in the open. I don't really
            have any answers, just the facts.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the way, Minix
            <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/minix3/RMQgCbHxlX4/nHMGVVmIBQAJ">isn't vulnerable</a>
            to the Meltdown issue, because of some of its features I don't care about
            that I mentioned earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, it's been entertaining, but applying patches like this
            always feels so unsatisfying. "Not that I *really* care,
            but my system is 'secure' now, right?" What about all the
            other security vulnerabilities that haven't been
            discovered publicly yet? Or the countless known
            vulnerabilities in any of the many layers of hardware and
            software on the servers, desktops, and laptops that I use, that
            aren't just completely up to date?  I also kept thinking
            in the back of my mind.. didn't I read something in
            November or December about a secret processor that runs
            alongside every Intel CPU, in some kind of
            ultra-privileged mode, or "ring"?  If that were
            true... what good would an operating system patch be?  I
            feel like I watched a YouTube video of some talk about this,
            but couldn't find anything related in my browser history.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went back to Minix, browsing through their
            <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/minix3">mailing
            list</a> reading about Minix's lack of amd64 and SMP
            support, and saw a new post called "minix the most used OS
            in the world". This sounded like a joke, and similar to
            the beginning of the title of a debate I mentioned earlier
            &mdash; there was a post to the mailing list in 1992 titled
            "LINUX is obsolete".
            Actually,
            <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/minix3/cIRormiMRaA">the new post</a>
            refreshed my memory, and I looked up some articles about Minix and Intel, leading to:
            <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3236064/servers/minix-the-most-popular-os-in-the-world-thanks-to-intel.html">MINIX — The most popular OS in the world, thanks to Intel</a>, which describes
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine">Intel Management Engine</a>,
            the source of my MINIX nightmare. The full description of
            a secret processor running on most of our computers,
            running Minix (thanks, no doubt, to its lax choice
            of open licensing &mdash; free as in do-whatever-you-want),
            with access to everything in the main CPU,
            and a web server. Mystery solved!
        </p>
        <p>
            Always willing to jump at an opportunity, the 
            Free Software Foundation uses the Spectre/Meltdown issue
            to <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/the-management-engine-an-attack-on-computer-users-freedom">remind us</a>
            that these patches are nice but there are already ways to
            get data out of Intel's computers using the Intel
            Management Engine. So, again.. deeply unsatisfying, and I
            take comfort in the fact that I don't really care who
            knows what about me. I just hope my bank account doesn't
            get hacked cause my new annual lease agreement just
            arrived &mdash; my rent is going up by like $120 next
            month. WHAT THE HELL.
