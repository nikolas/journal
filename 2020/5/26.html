                <h2>ModSecurity</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://modsecurity.org/">ModSecurity</a>
                    is a web application firewall with a long history,
                    originally designed for Apache (the project was
                    started before nginx was even around).
                </p>

                <p>
                    What's an application firewall? ModSecurity looks
                    at every request that comes through nginx. If it meets certain parameters, 
                    (defined by the <a href="https://coreruleset.org/">OWASP core rule set<a>),
                    the request is immediately denied with a 403 error.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ModSecurity 3, released a few years ago, has been
                    adapting itself from an apache module to a
                    server-independent library -
                    libmodsecurity. I'm setting this up for an Ubuntu 18.04 server,
                    but the steps will be similar for any Unix system.
                    Ubuntu 20.04 provides a
                    <a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libmodsecurity3">libmodsecurity3</a>
                    package. So, I can take
                    advantage of that when I'm on Ubuntu 20, but
                    even then I'll still have to compile my own
                    <a href="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx">nginx module</a> 
                    to connect this to nginx.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here are the pieces you need to get ModSecurity working with nginx:
                </p>

                <h3>libmodsecurity</h3>
                <p>
                    libmodsecurity itself. Compiled
                    from <a href="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/">https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/</a>,
                    synonymous with "ModSecurity".
                </p>

                <h3>ModSecurity-nginx</h3>
                <p>
                    The nginx module. Compiled from <a href="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx/">https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx/</a>.
                    In order to compile this, you need to download
                    the <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx">nginx</a>
                    source code at the right version (in our case,
                    1.14.0). The configure flags passed during the
                    configure step must also match those that our
                    version of nginx was compiled with, by Ubuntu (You
                    get these with <code>nginx -V</code>), or use
                    the <code>--with-compat</code> flag.
                <p>

                <p>
                    From the nginx source directory:
                </p>

                <pre>
./auto/configure --add-module=/path/to/ModSecurity-nginx --with-compat
                </pre>


                <h3>OWASP coreruleset</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://coreruleset.org/">https://coreruleset.org/</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset">https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Some of these rules require libmodsecurity to be
                    compiled with certain library support. For
                    example, the geolocation rules require a
                    libmodsecurity with either GeoIP or MaxMind
                    enabled. These are IP location databases. We're
                    currently using GeoIP. I had an issue with MaxMind
                    - the version that Ubuntu 18 provides is too old
                    for ModSecurity.
                </p>

                <h2>Connecting everything together</h2>

                <p>
                    All these pieces are connected with these configuration files:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</strong>: This file needs to load the modsecurity nginx module, and turn <code>modsecurity on</code>, and set <code>modsecurity_rules_file /etc/nginx/modsecurity/main.conf</code></li>
                    <li><strong>/etc/nginx/modsecurity/main.conf</strong>: This file loads <code>/etc/nginx/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf</code> along with the core ruleset files. It's pretty simple, and here's an example:</li>
                </ul>

                <pre>
# From https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/blob/master/
# modsecurity.conf-recommended
#
# Edit to set SecRuleEngine On
Include "/etc/nginx/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf"

Include "/etc/nginx/modsecurity/coreruleset/crs-setup.conf"
Include "/etc/nginx/modsecurity/coreruleset/rules/*.conf"

# Basic test rule
SecRule ARGS:testparam "@contains test" "id:1234,deny,status:403"
                </pre>

                <p>
                    After restarting nginx, if everything's working as
                    expected, you should see the following line
                    in <code>/var/log/nginx/error.log</code> after
                    nginx starts up:
                </p>

                <pre>
2020/05/21 12:08:51 [notice] 6362#6362: ModSecurity-nginx v1.0.1 \
  (rules loaded inline/local/remote: 0/907/0)
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Note that 907 local rules were loaded here, that's
                    from the OWASP ruleset. Because of the test rule
                    in
                    <code>main.conf</code>, you can also test this by
                    making a request to your server with the GET param
                    <code>?testparam=test</code>. That request should
                    be denied with a 403 error.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, take a look
                    in <code>/var/log/modsec_audit.log</code>
                    and <code>/var/log/nginx/error.log</code>. There
                    will be lots of interesting info in these files as
                    requests are blocked by ModSecurity. You might
                    need to tune your new firewall if you're seeing
                    false positives &mdash; I'm still learning about
                    that process, and I'll have another post
                    documenting that.
