                    I attended
                    <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/">FOSDEM</a> in
                    Brussels on February 1st and 2nd, last weekend. It
                    was pretty overwhelming, the amount of people
                    throughout the ULB campus. The number of people
                    attending is around 8,000, and at this conference,
                    there are 30 different talks going on at any one time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even after reading the
                    <a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2019/10/15/how-to-survive-fosdem/">How to survive FOSDEM</a> guide before my trip,
                    I still felt under prepared when I got there.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the K building there were booths for a bunch of
                    Linux distros and different software projects.  At
                    the end was a booth
                    for <a href="https://play0ad.com/">0 A.D.</a>, a
                    strategy game I've never played but might try
                    soon.  If I go again next year, I'm definitely
                    going to prepare more, have specific things I want
                    to work on or find out about, and I'll also know
                    what to expect. In the closing keynote, it was
                    mentioned that one of the main draws of FOSDEM now
                    is the
                    <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/tracks/">devrooms</a>,
                    which is a whole other aspect of the conference
                    that I didn't explore. I'm not sure if these are
                    more hackathons or focused project-based talks,
                    but if I return next year I'll find out.

                <p>
                    Here's an overview of some of the talks I took
                    notes on, with links to the recordings.
                </p>

                <h3><a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/automation/">Over Twenty Years Of Automation</a> - James Shubin</h3>
                <p>
                    The creator of 
                    <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt">mgmtconfig</a>
                    describes the history of configuration management.
                    He gives demos for many different systems,
                    including a simple shell scripting + ssh combo,
                    puppet, chef, ansible, docker, and others. He doesn't
                    mention Salt, but it seems really similar to Ansible.
                    They're both based on Python and YAML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The future of config management? According to
                    James, it's a "choreography" model instead of
                    orchestration. Instead of a salt master, every
                    node would follow its own algorithm and know how to
                    take care of itself, while still being aware of
                    all nodes around it. The downside here is that
                    implemention, debugging, and everything, can be
                    more complicated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He makes a point to note that docker and
                    kubernetes are not configuration management
                    systems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    His own project, mgmtconfig, is like salt, but
                    changes are updated immediately instead of through
                    a periodic highstate. He describes it as
                    "reactive".

                <h3><a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/blender/">Blender, Coming of Age</a> - Ton Roosendaal</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a talk about the origins of the
                    <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender
                    project</a>, by its founder. He goes through the
                    whole history, from before Blender existed in the
                    90s, to how they sustain their business now, with 
                    a bunch of film and graphics demos demonstrating
                    how advanced their rendering systems have become.

                <h3><a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/early_unix/">The Hidden Early History of Unix</a> - Warner Losh</h3>
                <p>
                    The speaker goes through the history of Unix and
                    uncovers some nearly forgotten details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Columbia University was mentioned as the first
                    university to receive Unix from Bell Labs in the
                    1970s.
                </p>


                <h3><a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/generation_gaps/">Generation Gaps</a> - Liam Proven</h3>
                <p>
                    The speaker goes through the history of operating systems,
                    how and when we've seen fundamental changes. Software
                    advancements have always followed hardware changes, and
                    usually when something about the hardware is removed,
                    or the computer "gets worse", or simpler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We now have computers based on 70s workstation
                    technology ... You can go with 40 years of
                    accumulated baggage from the IBM PC (Windows 1),
                    or, you can go with Unix and have 50 years of
                    accumulated baggage!" We now have incredibly
                    complex operating systems that no one really
                    understands.  But hey, they get the job done,
                    we've fixed most of the bugs, and we'll just keep
                    adding more and more fixes and incremental
                    improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liam thinks that the next major change in
                    computing (i.e., the next piece of hardware to be
                    removed) is the hard drive.  With new RAM designs,
                    we can design an operating system entirely in
                    memory - no disk swapping, no file systems. No
                    need for boot loader, or even init or and shutdown
                    scripts.  Just turn the computer off, and turn it
                    back on, and it's running just as it left off,
                    everything in memory. That could really change how
                    we think about software.

                <p>
                    In this talk, Liam mentions
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4">The
                    Future of Programming</a>, a talk by Bret Victor
                    in 2013, made from the perspective of 1973,
                    complete with an old-fashioned slide deck and a
                    pocket protector.

                <h3><a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/http3/">HTTP/3 for everyone</a> - Daniel Stenberg</h3>
                <p>
                    This talk was completely packed, in the main J
                    auditorium.  I'm not sure why.  The author
                    of <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>
                    describes making a new, faster HTTP protocol based
                    on UDP instead of TCP.

                <p>
                    I saw some interesting talks, but there's at least
                    as much info to dig through in the video recordings
                    for all the talks, here: <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2020/">https://video.fosdem.org/2020/</a> 
                    (These are organized by room number.. the title/speaker
                    info for each talk can be found 
                    <a href="https://review.video.fosdem.org/overview">here</a>).
                    These talks will all be available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fosdemtalks">here on YouTube</a> eventually,
                    but that's going to take a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some talks that I missed, but I still
                    want to watch, so I'm making notes for myself.
                </p>
                <h4><a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/linux_kernel/">The Linux Kernel: We have to finish this thing one day ;)</a> - Thorsten Leemhuis</h4>
                <p>
                    I found the closing keynotes underwhelming, but I
                    missed this opening keynote - I had just arrived at
                    ULB, was kind of lost, and the main auditorium (J) was
                    overflowing with people.
                </p>
                <h4><a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/rhdlp/">Reinventing Home Directories</a> - Lennart Poettering</h4>
                <p>
                    The systemd creator continues to cause controversy
                    and annoy Unix traditionalists. This talk was
                    completely overflowed with people, even outside
                    the door, with both fans and critics, waiting to
                    talk to Lennart about his ideas.
                    In this talk he
                    describes his latest idea, to handle home directories
                    with systemd in a more self-contained way:
                    <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=systemd-homed">systemd-homed</a>. The
                    first thought that comes to my mind is... why???
                    I'll just have to watch the talk.
